1
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:02,611
Last time on Naomi...

2
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:09,313
Every superhero has an
origin story and this is mine.

3
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:11,576
What's going on?

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,424
Annabelle says there's a
stunt happening in the square.

5
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,580
Something happened to me
during the Superman thing.

6
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:17,104
Then I went to the woods

7
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:19,062
and found some kind of disc.

8
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:21,388
It can be hard once you realize
you're not like everyone else.

9
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:22,892
Stay back!

10
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,984
You were there
on the day I was adopted.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,726
Who... Who are you?

12
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,076
Still asking the wrong question.

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,035
What is the question?

14
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:37,949
Who am I?

15
00:00:58,145 --> 00:00:59,842
I don't know who you are.

16
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:01,844
Not exactly.

17
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:04,281
But I know that it all started

18
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:06,979
March 14th, 2004,

19
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:10,026
when I saw the light in the sky.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,767
That's when I first sensed it.

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,203
Sensed what?

22
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:14,247
You.

23
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:16,467
What does that mean?

24
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:20,384
There are invisible
vibrations all around us.

25
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,517
In the air, in the water,

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
the trees.

27
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:25,520
People like us

28
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:30,177
have a unique
vibrational signature.

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,309
Think of it like
a, uh, fingerprint.

30
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,705
My wings give me
the ability to sense it.

31
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:38,228
Your wings,
because you have wings.

32
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:42,319
They're a part of me,

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,887
made from a rare metal

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,018
found on...

35
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:49,064
my home planet.

36
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
Your home planet?

37
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,157
Thanagar.

38
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:57,507
Thanagar...

39
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,250
Right.

40
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,426
But if you're from another
planet, that would mean...

41
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,386
I'm not human.

42
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:09,259
And if your, if your special wings
could sense me, that would mean...

43
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:10,478
You're not human either.

44
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:15,657
Okay.

45
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,180
This isn't real.

46
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:19,095
I'm having a very
bad dream right now

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,705
and I just need to wake up.

48
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,707
Just wake up Naomi,
just wake up, just wake up.

49
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:27,408
Sometimes when I'm stressed, I, uh...
I do some deep breathing.

50
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,584
I think I'll stick with the
straight-up panic attack.

51
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:32,716
I know it's a lot.

52
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:36,286
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

53
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,768
You don't just blow up
someone's life for no reason.

54
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,161
Your abilities seemed dormant.

55
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,379
You seemed...

56
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,122
happy.

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,823
I think that's enough
for tonight.

58
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:54,174
You should go home
and get some rest.

59
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,959
I'm pretty sure I'm never
gonna sleep again,

60
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,266
and plus, I have like a
million more questions.

61
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:00,832
I know,

62
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,486
and I'll do my best
to answer them.

63
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,357
I promise.

64
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,142
Tomorrow.

65
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,709
Please.

66
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:11,582
You just told me I'm an
alien from outer space.

67
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:14,455
No disrespect, but am I really
just supposed to believe you?

68
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,412
No.

69
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
I'll prove it.

70
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:36,259
I know my birth parents
died in a crash...

71
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,045
but what kind?

72
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,526
Was it a car or a plane
or a bus?

73
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:46,269
We don't know, pumpkin.

74
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:47,792
You know we don't know.

75
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:51,056
We've talked about this
dozens of times.

76
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,362
Baby, what's going on?

77
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:53,884
Nothing.

78
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:01,197
I guess I've just been
thinking about it,

79
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,503
lately, that's all.

80
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:04,331
That's completely normal.

81
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,942
You're getting older and
it's natural to want answers.

82
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:09,640
We wish we had them, but
you know everything we know.

83
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,557
But is there anything else?

84
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,299
Like what town, or was
anyone else there?

85
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:19,223
All the agency would tell us is that
it was on the East Coast. It was a...

86
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,348
It was a closed adoption.

87
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,786
But didn't it bother you?

88
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:28,050
Not knowing who I really am
or where I actually came from?

89
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,008
None of that mattered to us.

90
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,053
It still doesn't.

91
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,447
We know who you are.

92
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:35,623
You're our daughter.

93
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:37,799
Our miracle.

94
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,328
I better...

95
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:48,505
start getting ready.

96
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:49,549
Excuse me.

97
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:55,685
I'm sorry, Dad.

98
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,515
We're your parents.

99
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:01,431
Keeping you safe
is basically our entire job.

100
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,260
So it's...

101
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,624
hard to accept that we can't
keep you safe from everything.

102
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:10,788
But what I can promise

103
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,530
is that we love you

104
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:15,749
and we are here for you.

105
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:18,840
I know that, Dad.

106
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:19,883
I really do.

107
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:22,451
Good.

108
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,413
Better get to school.

00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,349
Sorry, I thought you might, uh,
want some caffeine

131
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,698
after our late night expedition.

132
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,831
That's really nice, thanks.

133
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:38,374
I'm sorry we didn't find that disc
you were looking for at Zumbado's.

134
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,790
Oh! That's okay.

135
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,575
Uh... I mean, it was fun though.

136
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:44,447
Hanging out with you
is always fun, actually, uh,

137
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,667
and, I mean, it got me thinking.

138
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,192
I was wondering if maybe you wanted
to, um, hang out this weekend? Or...

139
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:53,456
Maybe without the trespassing.

140
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,458
We could try that new,
uh, pizza place.

141
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,242
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Pizza sounds good.

142
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:58,461
Really?

143
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,158
Okay, great, okay, wow, okay!

144
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,551
All right, text me later?

145
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,205
Okay, yes,
I'll... I'll text you later.

146
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,248
Thanks for this!

147
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,163
You're welcome.

148
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:15,999
Dee?

149
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,002
Naomi.

150
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,046
You made it.

151
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:23,736
I don't really like heights.

152
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,490
Did you know

153
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:30,054
that the first bridges were built
by the people of ancient Egypt?

154
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,930
No machinery.

155
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,716
Just chisels and stones
with their own two hands.

156
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,459
Humans have the capacity
to do incredible things.

157
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:41,809
What are we doing here?

158
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,289
Jumping.

159
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,773
Hold up, you're serious?

160
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:50,817
You asked for proof.

161
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,472
Here it is.

162
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,995
You'll defy gravity.

163
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,127
You won't even make a splash.

164
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:57,651
You won't get hurt.

165
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,609
That's easy for you to say.
You have wings.

166
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,610
True.

167
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,094
Have you ever had a broken bone?

168
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:08,705
Stitches?

169
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,185
Any injuries at all?

170
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:11,360
Sure.

171
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:12,403
When?

172
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,527
You've never been injured...

173
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,411
because you're not like
everyone else.

174
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,372
Besides, if I'm wrong,

175
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:24,695
what's the worst
that can happen?

176
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,857
You make a big splash,
break your foot.

177
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,380
That sounds pretty bad.

178
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,470
You're afraid.

179
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,472
You just told me
to jump off a bridge.

180
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,387
What happened to you
in the woods,

181
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,041
the lights going out in my shop,

182
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,565
that was all you.

183
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,525
The sooner you accept that,
the safer you'll be.

184
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:47,656
Safe from what?

185
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:50,834
Your world has
fundamentally changed

186
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,056
and I doubt I'm
the only one who's noticed.

187
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,321
We need to get you ready.

188
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:09,765
It's impossible.

189
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,074
Superman once told me,

190
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,947
impossible is relative.

191
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:17,991
Superman?

192
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,690
I fought with him in a war

193
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,734
a long time ago.

194
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:24,607
He is real, Naomi.

195
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:32,832
No.

196
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,314
I'm sorry, but no.

197
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,056
Superheroes are not real.
Aliens are not real.

198
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,843
Your wings must have been some kind
of harness or machine or something.

199
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:48,370
And the light that you saw in the sky
was probably a meteor or satellite.

200
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:51,333
I'm gonna find the crash site and figure
out what really happened that day.

201
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,466
You're not ready.

202
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:05,430
To accept that I'm an alien
from outer space? No.

203
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:06,474
No, I'm not.

204
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:14,221
Dee!

205
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,753
Finding the crash site
won't change the truth, Naomi.

206
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:25,711
This is real,

207
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,671
whether you believe it or not.

208
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,289
Mrs. M! Hi! Is that a new top?

209
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,900
Loving that color on you.

210
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,685
Thanks, honey.
I went shopping last week.

211
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:46,123
You were right, I can pull off pastels.
Want a smoothie?

212
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,952
You know I do.
Naomi sent me a soft 911.

213
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:52,173
It's one step down from an
actual medical emergency.

214
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:55,306
It includes, but is not
limited to, romantic emergency,

215
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,745
school emergency, snack
emergency, fashion emergency.

216
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,094
Good to know.

217
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,139
She's working
on a school project.

218
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,141
It's a little...
intense in there.

219
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,754
♪ I'm true to my squad

220
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,253
♪ I'm true to my dead ones Who
walk with me Know when I'm flawed ♪

221
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:11,192
♪ I'm true to my squad

222
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,170
♪ True to the people who see me
Right through the facade ♪

223
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:15,675
You know, I always thought
we'd be cute, little old ladies

224
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,720
before we went full
conspiracy theorist.

225
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:18,982
Good, you're here.

226
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:21,463
Uh, can you come
help me with this?

227
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,900
What's going on here, babe?

228
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:26,686
It's a topographic map
of Port Oswego.

229
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:30,646
It's pretty dope. It shows water,
elevation, surface features.

230
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,303
No, um, what's going on here?

231
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:38,698
There was a UFO sighting back
in Port Oswego in 2004.

232
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,136
And we're hunting
aliens because...

233
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,834
We're not. That's the point.

234
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:49,752
UFO doesn't mean aliens. It
means unidentified flying object.

235
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:52,799
So, I'm trying to identify it.

236
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:58,935
Right. Weren't we on a disc
mission, like, five minutes ago?

237
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,068
This is more important.

238
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:04,201
There've been a lot of UFO sightings
in Port Oswego, like, a lot.

239
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:05,681
Did you know that?

240
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,901
Can't say that I did.

241
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,904
A lot of people thought that the March
14th UFO landed in Red River Forest.

242
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:14,385
But I compared the wind reports
to an article about soil testing

243
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:17,171
and my theory is that it landed
somewhere around Falls Creek.

244
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,782
I want to go look around.

245
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,186
Mom said that
I can borrow the car.

246
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,439
March 14th, 2004?

247
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,615
As in the day you were adopted.

248
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:29,115
I think it was a secret military drone
and that's why no one came forward.

249
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,968
- Apparently the government was running this...
- Naomi!

250
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,492
You are telling me,
on the day you were adopted,

251
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:40,194
way on the others side of the country, there
was a UFO sighting here in Port Oswego...

252
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,065
where you now live.

253
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,980
Smoothie time.

254
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,504
Fresh fruits and vitamin C
coming your way.

255
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,158
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're the best, Mrs. M.

256
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,160
Naomi, I just got
a call from Dad.

257
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,644
He's stuck at work so you won't
be able to use the car tonight.

258
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,733
Don't worry.

259
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,822
I happen to know somebody
else who loves UFOs.

260
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,379
No offense, hon, but will this
thing even make it to Falls Creek?

261
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,535
Shh. You'll hurt her feelings.

262
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,799
Who wants snacks?

263
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,496
Ooh, now it's a road trip.

264
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,324
- You got any gummy bears in there?
- Ew!

265
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,283
Thank you.

266
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,160
You wanted to see me, sir?

267
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,336
I did. Come on in, Major.

268
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,468
Have a seat.

269
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:38,905
Very impressive resume, Major.

270
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,647
Counterintelligence analyst
for the DOD,

271
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,867
on-the-ground experience
in several countries.

272
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:45,911
Thank you, sir.

273
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:52,135
You're aware of the incident that happened
a few days ago in the town square.

274
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,268
The Superman publicity stunt?

275
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,531
We're not sure what it was.

276
00:13:56,574 --> 00:14:00,622
All we know is that it was an
unidentified flying object near our base.

277
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,992
I thought the owner of the tattoo
shop admitted to planning it.

278
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:06,628
He did. But we think that
there is more to the story.

279
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:19,467
Our team found this during a
sweep of the Red River Forest

280
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,382
near the alleged landing site.

281
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,906
Our lab techs have had it
for the last couple of days.

282
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,954
We can't break it, burn it, blow it up.
It's virtually indestructible.

283
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:34,221
Sounds like boron carbide or maybe
some other kind of synthetic.

284
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:35,744
That's what I thought.

285
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,573
But the technology
is far more advanced.

286
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:40,967
It's unlike anything
we've ever seen.

287
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,423
And you think it has something
to do with the Superman incident?

288
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,927
I don't know what to think.

289
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,731
Why would Dee say
he planned it if he didn't?

290
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:50,033
What does he have
to do with this?

291
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,242
That's what I need you
to find out.

292
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,371
I am definitely not wearing
the right shoes for this.

293
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,427
Speaking of shoes, Naomi,

294
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,796
let's talk about what pair you're
gonna wear on your date with Anthony.

295
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,537
- What?
- My first thought is your blue high tops

296
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,481
but your Chucks could be
super cute too. I mean...

297
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,087
No, what do you mean, date?

298
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,530
Was Anthony not supposed
to tell me?

299
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:18,352
I think he was just excited.

300
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:21,616
We're having pizza like we do
all the time. It's not a date.

301
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:24,227
It's not a date!

302
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,274
So much internal cringe, babe.

303
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:29,579
What's in the suitcase?

304
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,539
My gear.

305
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:34,324
Every good UFO investigator
has gear.

306
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,408
He thinks aliens are real.

307
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:37,719
Really?

308
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,025
Definitely.

309
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,708
It's pretty much
a mathematical certainty.

310
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,335
But there's never been
any proof that they exist.

311
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,139
There's never been
any proof that they don't.

312
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,739
What exactly are we looking for?

313
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:00,046
I mean, 16 years is a long time.

314
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,179
Debris or any other
evidence of a crash.

315
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,181
Trees that are broken.
Newer growth.

316
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,661
Scorch marks or burns.

317
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,030
There could also be
trace elements.

318
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,577
Like radiation or chemicals.

319
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,058
I'm good.

320
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:16,497
Latex isn't really my color.

321
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,324
Let's get started.

322
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,457
♪ You know you wanna

323
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,511
I should have worn gloves.
This sap is everywhere.

324
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,818
It's bigleaf maple.

325
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,342
Very tasty on pancakes,
but very messy.

326
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,091
Naomi?

327
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,135
Naomi.

328
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:32,876
Naomi!

329
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,530
Are you okay?

330
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:36,707
I could hear it, Annabelle.

331
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,447
Hear what?

332
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:40,188
Everything.

333
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,239
Okay.

334
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,632
Don't freak out.

335
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,853
See, when someone says that, it means
you definitely should be freaking out.

336
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:52,896
Are you moving?

337
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:58,251
After we broke into Zumbado's,
I went to see Dee and...

338
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,906
things got weird.

339
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,581
He sprouted these, like, actual
metal wings and then he told me that

340
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:09,653
he's an alien from outer space and that he
thinks that I too am an alien from outer space.

341
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:14,005
Oh, and he also said
that Superman is real.

342
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,163
Annabelle, please say something.

343
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:23,885
I am literally speechless.

344
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,819
It's never happened
to me before.

345
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,761
OMG, babe! Are you a superhero?

346
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,546
No! No.

347
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,939
Suddenly the whole UFO thing
makes so much more sense...

348
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:39,161
Wait, why are we trying to
prove you're not a superhero?

349
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,990
Aliens aren't real.
Superheroes aren't real.

350
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,948
Right?

351
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:46,168
But what if they are?

352
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:49,824
If you could be any character from
Greek mythology, who would you be?

353
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,042
What?

354
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,653
It's, uh, one of my questions.

355
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:55,046
For our project?

356
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,787
Here's my list.

357
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:58,441
Mine's not done yet. I'm sorry.

358
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,140
I'd be Zeus.

359
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,621
He has like, a ton of powers,
which make him the coolest.

360
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:09,060
Maybe having all those powers
wasn't actually that fun.

361
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:14,327
Or maybe Zeus wished that he could just
be regular god without all the pressure.

362
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,720
Or maybe he didn't want
to be a god at all.

363
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:20,246
What is happening right now?

364
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,553
Nothing.

365
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,637
Can you come by after soccer
to work on our project?

366
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,167
Sure.

367
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,840
Do you think your mom
would make me a smoothie?

368
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:32,127
Totally. Yesterday's had
fresh coconut.

369
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,781
The woman is a visionary.

370
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:39,786
Thanks for this.

371
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:41,657
Anytime.

372
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,751
All these trees
look exactly the same.

373
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,798
What are we hoping to see here?

374
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,714
Patterns, markings, anything we
might have missed at the site.

375
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:01,374
Wait, is this Falls Creek?

376
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,817
I can't believe you guys went there.
Because of Steve O'Brien?

377
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,834
Since you are looking into the
2004 sighting, I assumed you knew.

378
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:09,773
It's a Port Oswego urban legend.

379
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:13,560
Let's definitely tell horror
stories in an actual dark room.

380
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:17,868
So, Steve is this local guy
who is obsessed with UFOs.

381
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:22,395
And in 2004 he would have been a
junior or senior in high school.

382
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:27,008
He and some friends went into the
woods to look for the crash site.

383
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:30,925
And apparently some weird stuff
started to happen at Falls Creek.

384
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:32,666
What kind of weird stuff?

385
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,494
It depends on who you ask.

386
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:36,974
Some people think he saw
the ghosts of dead loggers

387
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:41,196
and other people claim
he saw Bigfoot.

388
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,547
Lot of people just think he was
high with his friends. But, uh...

389
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:48,769
After he came back from the woods,
Steve refused to talk about it.

390
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,948
Where is he now?

391
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,191
He still lives in Port Oswego.

392
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,567
This is where Steve lives?

393
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:07,440
Was really expecting more of
a cabin in the woods vibe,

394
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,312
It's a lot less true crime
and more mommy blogger.

395
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:19,756
Anthony, you got tall.

396
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,386
Thanks for making the time to see us, Mr.
O'Brien.

397
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,455
Sure, sure.

398
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:23,804
How's your dad these days?

399
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,022
Ah, my father's good, sir.

400
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,198
Work's just a little slow.

401
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:30,506
Uh, my dad and Mr. O'Brien have done
some logging jobs back in the day.

402
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,856
So, what can I do for you?

403
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,424
Anthony said something
about a school project.

404
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,210
It's about the UFO back in 2004.

405
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,826
I'm not really
into UFOs any more.

406
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,523
Because of what happened
in 2004?

407
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,221
It's less about what happened

408
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,702
and more about what I wanted
for my life.

409
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:57,577
I realized I could keep
being the strange UFO guy

410
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,449
or I could fit in with
everyone else, be normal.

411
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,979
What happened back then?

412
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,244
I... I don't like
to talk about it.

413
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:14,550
Please.

414
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:15,594
It's important.

415
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,076
Um, I can't really explain it.
I just...

416
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,863
I feel like I'm meant
to solve this.

417
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,956
I remember that feeling.

418
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,227
I was skateboarding
in the square

419
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,576
when I saw the light that day.

420
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:58,333
So me and a couple of my friends

421
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,509
decided to try
and find the crash site.

422
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:04,992
We were almost to the mill

423
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:08,038
when things started to happen.

424
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,088
The woods
started to feel... alive.

425
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,178
We heard voices.

426
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,443
Lots of... Lots of voices.

427
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,012
We never saw
anyone else out there.

428
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,844
What happened when
you got to the mill?

429
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,716
We never made it inside.

430
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,457
We were almost there.

431
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,501
We heard this...

432
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:38,939
horrible noise.

433
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,944
And then I saw this
really bright light...

434
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,470
and that's all
I can remember before.

435
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,081
Before what?

436
00:23:55,434 --> 00:24:01,483
Um, I was somehow back at the car
and I have no idea how I got there.

437
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:11,188
We didn't see a mill
at Falls Creek.

438
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:14,931
- Falls Creek?
- The crash site.

439
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:20,502
The UFO didn't land at Falls Creek.
We were a few miles away.

440
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,942
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

441
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,172
We have to find that mill.

442
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,479
No, thank you.

443
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:43,153
Those voices Steve heard must have been
someone trying to cover up the crash.

444
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,005
Maybe the military
or someone else.

445
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:49,836
Jacob, you're with me, right?

446
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:51,793
Definitely.

447
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,407
Well, not technically.

448
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:57,451
I'm with you in spirit.

449
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:02,762
My backlog of homework is
getting pretty serious.

450
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:03,806
Same.

451
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,112
Me, too.

452
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,722
No, we have to solve this!

453
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,510
I thought we were
just having fun.

454
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
You're right.

455
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,780
I'm sorry.

456
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:23,043
Thanks for all your help.
We should pack this up.

457
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,131
I'll go get some boxes.

458
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:43,802
Is this a safe space?

459
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,546
I'm sorry for snapping at you.

460
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:54,030
I know that weird stuff
is happening to me, but,

461
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:56,642
aliens, superheroes.
It's crazy, right?

462
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:58,817
I don't know, babe.

463
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,561
I mean, yes, it seems crazy,

464
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:03,866
maybe even impossible, but...

465
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:10,003
I mean, people used to think
the Earth was flat.

466
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:14,790
Doctors used to not wash their hands
before surgery, which is very gross.

467
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:16,394
We didn't even know
gravity was a thing.

468
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,971
Even if you're right,
even if there are...

469
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,582
aliens and superheroes,

470
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,108
why does it have to be me?

471
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:31,720
What do you mean?

472
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:36,856
I'm adopted. I was always moving
around because of my dad's job.

473
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:42,122
Most of the time I was the only Black
girl in my town or in my school.

474
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:45,865
My whole life has been about being
different and now I'm supposed to...

475
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:49,390
accept the fact that I'm literally
an alien from outer space.

476
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,350
I just want to be normal.

477
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,662
You are a lot of things, babe,
but normal is not one of them.

478
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,623
You, Naomi McDuffie,
are exceptional.

479
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:07,694
I'm pretty sure you're biased.

480
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,803
No, it's a fact.

481
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:16,547
So you know the Serenity Prayer?

482
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:20,377
"May I be granted the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change,"

483
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:22,118
the courage to change
the things I can,

484
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,121
"and the wisdom to know
the difference."

485
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,212
I think what it means is that

486
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:32,825
there's some things in life we
can't change and that's okay.

487
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,743
I'm scared, Annabelle.

488
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:40,962
I know.

489
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:43,922
And that's okay too.

490
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,844
But denying something
doesn't make it any less real.

491
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:55,978
Maybe accepting it is the first
step towards making it less scary.

492
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:05,727
More cheese. A little more.

493
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:08,729
A little more.

494
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:11,559
A little more.

495
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,041
Perfect. You're a natural.

496
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:17,957
The secret to Mom's pasta
is ninety percent cheese.

497
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,480
She's right.

498
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:22,657
Speaking of, I left
a grocery bag in the car.

499
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,311
Naomi, take these bowls
to your friends.

500
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:28,575
You're still here.

501
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,579
We all are.

502
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:35,322
If this UFO hunt is important
to you, it's important to us.

503
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,933
Also, I couldn't say no to
Mrs. McDuffie's pasta, so...

504
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:45,593
Hope I'm not interrupting.

505
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:46,899
Nathan, what are you doing here?

506
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,204
Your mom let me in.

507
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:49,640
What's he doing here?

508
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,468
You know, I'm standing
right here.

509
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:54,210
Could you, um, take these
bowls to Jacob and Annabelle?

510
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,742
What are you doing here?

511
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,265
Seriously?

512
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,658
You told me to come by
after soccer practice.

513
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:09,443
Oh, our project.

514
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,401
You keep forgetting
about our project.

515
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:12,968
You forgot I was coming over.

516
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,928
And then when I show up,
all these people are here.

517
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:16,971
Anthony's here?

518
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,149
That's pretty not cool.

519
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,543
I know.
I'm sorry. I can explain.

520
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,025
All right.

521
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:34,511
Hey, what's going on
with you, for real?

522
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,644
Nothing.

523
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,515
I just have a lot on my mind,
that's all.

524
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,866
Is this about Dee?

525
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,781
What?

526
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,984
When we went to see him the
other day, you seemed upset.

527
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,397
I know we're not together,
but...

528
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
I'm still your friend.

529
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,575
You can talk to me.

530
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:58,274
Naomi, you need to
come see this.

531
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,279
Steve said the mill
was close to the creek,

532
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:06,761
but none of these are
within a ten-mile radius.

533
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,893
Maybe Steve was wrong.

534
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:15,030
These are the only operational
mills near Falls Creek.

535
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:20,514
This is a Pacific Logging map.
It lists all the mills.

536
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,174
Pacific #42
decommissioned in 1989,

537
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,219
three miles away from the creek.

538
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:33,744
I feel like I, uh, missed a lot.

539
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:34,988
We'll catch you up on the way.

540
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:37,618
I guess homework
will have to wait.

541
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,627
Is it just me, or is this
car getting a little crowded?

542
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,551
Uh-oh.

543
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,732
I knew this car was
living on borrowed time.

544
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,603
Time to call AAA?

545
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,040
I have a better idea.

546
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,917
You guys are really
bad at hitchhiking.

547
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,527
Thanks for coming, Lourdes.

548
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,491
You know I'm always happy
to get a text from you.

549
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:29,365
We have to walk
the rest of the way.

550
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,585
It's about a mile.

551
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:34,240
This is the beginning of
literally every horror movie.

552
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:42,264
What the hell is this?

553
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,572
These markings were on the disc.

554
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:55,582
Someone's coming.
Guys, we have to go.

555
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,149
I know you're here, Naomi.

556
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,188
And you brought your friends.

557
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,688
Did you know someone
broke into my dealership?

558
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:18,648
That's called
criminal trespassing.

559
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:22,217
Police came by, asked if I had
any idea who might have done it.

560
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,526
I'm still deciding
on what to tell them.

561
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,793
You all must really care about Naomi
to put yourselves in harm's way.

562
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:38,668
You can leave now, except Naomi.

563
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,844
- No way.
- Hell no!

564
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:43,456
If he thinks we're leaving you
here, he's crazier than we thought.

565
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:46,720
If I stay,
will my friends be safe?

566
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:49,201
I give you my word.

567
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:50,767
That does not
make me feel better.

568
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,528
We are not leaving you
alone with a criminal

569
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,597
who's doing creepy things
inside of a creepy mill.

570
00:33:54,641 --> 00:34:00,038
Annabelle, I'll be fine.
Remember? Zeus.

571
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:07,045
Fine. If Naomi says to go,
we should go.

572
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,088
We have to trust her.

573
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,704
We'll be right outside.

574
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:17,098
Aim for his eyes.

575
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:18,621
- Okay?
- Okay.

576
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:34,115
What do you want?
Why did you follow me here?

577
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:39,120
I want you to stay out of this
before you get hurt.

578
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:18,028
Impressive. Much more focused
than your display in the woods.

579
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:22,468
Using those will
get you into trouble.

580
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:24,078
What happened here
on March 14th?

581
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:28,996
Nothing to do with you.

582
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,476
You're lying.

583
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,279
If you're not gonna
believe me, then why ask?

584
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:38,179
What is this place?
What are those markings?

585
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,223
Tell me what's...

586
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,974
Stop messing with things
that you don't understand.

587
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:53,731
Go, and don't ever
come back here.

588
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:09,254
Anthony, wait up.

589
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:10,342
Thanks again, Lourdes.

590
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,865
Literally, anytime.

591
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,743
Hey! Are you sure you're okay?

592
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:23,137
Yeah, I'm fine.

593
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,096
I think Zumbado was just trying
to scare us or something.

594
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,055
Mission accomplished.

595
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:30,840
What was he even doing there? Was
that payback for the break-in?

596
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:32,841
I don't know.

597
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:38,718
Well... Hey, about that pizza...

598
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:41,807
I...

599
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,637
You changed your mind.

600
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,251
I didn't know you wanted
to get pizza like that.

601
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,687
Oh...

602
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,738
This is awkward.

603
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,175
No, no, I don't want it to be.

604
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,569
I just have a lot going on,

605
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:06,311
so for right now,
could we just stay friends?

606
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:09,488
Yeah. Yeah, of course. I get it.

607
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:12,360
No, I don't think you do.

608
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:18,453
I'm not saying no, Anthony,
I'm just saying not right now.

609
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,241
I can live with that.

610
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,387
What is going on here?

611
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:42,303
Naomi is doing a school project.

612
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:49,876
I tracked down
that actor Dee hired,

613
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:52,531
but all I got was
a full voice mailbox.

614
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:53,880
So it's a dead end?

615
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,318
It's feeling like it.

616
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,078
Commander Steel wants
to see me first thing.

617
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,887
He said he has
something to tell me.

618
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,931
Do you agree with him?

619
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:03,455
Is Dee some kind of threat?

620
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:04,891
I don't know if he's a threat,

621
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,072
but he's definitely
hiding something.

622
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:26,216
Why are you helping me?

623
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,876
You didn't have to
tell me the truth.

624
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:39,099
Wouldn't it have just been
easier for you to stay quiet?

625
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:45,235
I know what it feels like to
be different and not know why.

626
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:50,458
I really wanted you to be wrong.

627
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:55,245
I know.

628
00:38:55,289 --> 00:39:00,250
I told myself that if I could just prove
that something else happened on March 14th,

629
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:02,688
something real,

630
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:05,299
that things could just go back
to the way that they were,

631
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,606
before Superman,
before all of this.

632
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,261
Now I know I can't.

633
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:12,959
I don't know
what is happening to me.

634
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:18,094
All I know is that
it is happening.

635
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:23,709
And how do you feel?

636
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:26,538
Scared, confused, excited.

637
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,279
Dee, I think I have powers.

638
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:36,112
Yes, and they're actually
pretty great,

639
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:37,375
once you get used to them.

640
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:42,075
Could you introduce me
to Superman?

641
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:48,298
Um... Maybe one day.

642
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,534
Thank you for
telling me the truth.

643
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:00,180
You're welcome.

644
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:04,445
That energy thing,
it happened again,

645
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,569
like it did in the woods
and in here with the lights.

646
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:10,799
But this time,
I meant to cause it.

647
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:11,883
But I couldn't control it.

648
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:19,634
I think I can help with that.

649
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:24,631
Welcome to the team, Major.

650
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:32,212
Sir, what is a UAPTF?

651
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:35,650
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena
Task Force.

652
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:38,087
It was developed by
the DOD and Naval Intelligence

653
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:40,960
to investigate
otherworldly threats.

654
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:44,572
Otherworldly threats.
Like, uh... Like aliens?

655
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:47,009
That's right.

656
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:50,293
The Superman appearance was just the latest
in a long line of mysterious incidents.

657
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,364
So Superman's an alien?

658
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:56,541
Yes. We believe he might be.

659
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:59,935
You're saying aliens are real?

660
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,546
It's worse than that, Major.

661
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:03,504
We believe they're already here.

664
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,906
We have no idea what they want, or
what they're willing to do to get it,

665
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:18,171
so we have to assume they're
extremely dangerous and hostile.

666
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:20,652
♪ A couple bodies in the garden

667

Are you ready?

668
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:28,268
If there are aliens
in Port Oswego,

669
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:30,574
we will find them.

670
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:32,402
I'm ready to try.
