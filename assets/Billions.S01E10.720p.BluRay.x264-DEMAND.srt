00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,190
[Bill]
Previously on Billions...

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,634
Get everything you might
possibly need,

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,955
'cause they will destroy
anything left behind.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,231
You blew up your family
for Bobby Axelrod.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,193
I'm Keyser Sï¿½ze, motherfucker.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,710
Judge on the "Dollar" Bill case
is going to be Whit fucking Wilcox.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,909
Ugh.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,077
I wonder if re-presented a warrant
for bugging the Axelrod home...

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,395
No.
Asked and answered.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,080
Look into Wilcox.
Go wherever it leads.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,953
You're making a move
on a federal judge.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,308
Is he in your way?

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,908
If you were in my situation,
what would you do,

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,270
you know, if you hadn't done
anything wrong,

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,152
but you were targeted anyway?

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,589
You want me to pressure
my husband to back off.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,995
- You know I can't do that.
- Why not?

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,429
So I'm thrilled you got someone
on the inside at Axe Cap.

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,675
I have no idea,

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,633
because as you damn well know,
I've recused myself.

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,357
- [man] FBl!
- [gasps, exhales sharply]

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,754
- There's someone in the house.
- [Donnie] lt'll be fine.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,836
[Dale]
Sorry about your front door.

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,915
It's all right.
He can afford another one.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,035
- [handcuffs click]
- [Dale] Let's go.

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,195
Donnie Caan walked out.

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,753
He say anything
about where he was going?

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,717
I think it'd be good
if you found him, soon.

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,519
Where the fuck is Donnie?

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,359
He could decide to walk into their office
and tell 'em everything.

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,277
I'll testify against Axe,

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,391
but right now I need--
[coughs]

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,034
- [Terri] Ugh!
- Holy shit. Donnie? No.

34
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,037
Donnie.

35
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,674
- [Terri] Oh, fuck.
- [Bryan] Donnie.

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,278
? pensive music ?

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,394
???

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,389
[exhales deeply]

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,751
[indistinct conversations]

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,430
? pensive music ?

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,676
You know, I was, for a time,

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,315
supposed to become a Grandmaster.

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,556
Chess.

44
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,639
Fourteen years old
and leapfrogging up the standings.

45
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,909
[chuckles]

46
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,439
Put me in a practice game,

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,075
and I'd be a young Boris Spassky
in his prime.

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,679
By all rights,

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,792
I should've dominated live competition,

50
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,990
but I had a flaw.

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,991
???

52
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,310
If I decided that my opponent

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,116
didn't respect the game or me

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,834
or if I didn't like
the way he carried himself--

55
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,556
If I decided for whatever reason
that he wasn't worthy...

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,395
a dark rage would come over me.

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,193
???

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,552
And this rage became the driver.

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,434
All the strategy, patience,
and practice would vanish,

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,633
and I would begin obsessing
about total destruction.

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,513
Some kid could fail to look me in the eye

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,949
while shaking my hand
at a tournament in the fall,

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,159
and I would carry it
until facing him again in the spring.

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,272
But then while I was trying
to destroy him...

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,550
???

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,716
[laughs]
I'd forget to win.

67
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,233
???

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,750
I would play bold moves
designed to intimidate,

69
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,633
show him that he wasn't
as smart as me...

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,636
or as brave.

71
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,751
Leave voids in my defense.

72
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,348
That's not how you win at chess.

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,239
I knew better...

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,715
but, uh...

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,990
but I couldn't do better.

76
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,554
And then at the end of the game,

77
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,478
my opponent's arm
would be raised in victory,

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,433
while I sat...

79
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,269
humiliated and alone...

80
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,870
bathed in anger and defeat.

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,634
[sighs heavily]

82
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,196
Here I am again, beaten.

83
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,120
Although it has yet to be confirmed,

84
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,313
there is no doubt
that Donnie Caan is gonna die...

85
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,270
soon.

86
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,719
[chuckles]

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,355
I sat up all night until I saw it.

88
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,149
Bobby Axelrod used Donnie
to feed us information

89
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,114
that he would never live to testify to

90
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,111
or confirm in court.

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,076
[sighs]

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,629
We'll claw back
some of his trades, sure,

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,752
but we have to assume
that the names he gave us,

94
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,429
the specifics, all of it--false.

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,551
[sighs]

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,511
? pulsating music ?

97
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,792
No, I wish this loss were mine alone...

98
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,436
but I cost all of you as well.

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,552
Soon, probably within the hour,

100
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,148
uh, Adam DeGiulio
from the Attorney General's Office

101
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,111
will walk in here

102
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,676
and take us off the Axelrod case.

103
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,395
It won't matter that Axelrod
is everything I said he is--

104
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,670
a bloodless man,

105
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,598
a man who would use his dying friend

106
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,915
in the manner that he did.

107
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,508
We needed to be bloodless
to catch him,

108
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,757
and we weren't.

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,950
I wasn't.

110
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,957
???

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,071
We were all suckers here, Chuck.

112
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,350
No, don't try to fall on it, Bryan.

113
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,153
I set the tone.

114
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,679
That's what the papers will say.

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,870
They'll call me sloppy...

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,638
[sniffs]
...driven, unhinged.

117
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,911
And, uh, for once, they'll be correct.

118
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,030
What can we do?

119
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,594
???

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,029
We can, from this moment forward,

121
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,596
remember how the game
is supposed to be played.

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,557
We'll play perfect strategy.

123
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,310
We will retreat so we can attack
when it is to our advantage.

124
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,671
And then someday soon,
we will be standing here,

125
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,678
and it will be our turn.

126
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,678
? music fades ?

127
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,272
I don't want to stop you, Chuck.

128
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,118
No, we were just finishing up.

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,835
[scoffs]

130
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,838

[Wags] All right, get out there
and make some fucking money.

135
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,634
???

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,753
You got a handle on this?

137
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,438
I do not.

138
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,113
Well, I don't think it's good.

139
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,992
[telephone ringing in the distance]

[sighs]

- How fucked are you?
- Can I say it's nothing?

145
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,676
Could you let me get away with that?

146
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,074
[sighs]

147
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,316
Flu, maybe?

148
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,874
God, what would you pay to have
the flu right now, Donnie?

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,878
Anything.
[inhales deeply]

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,150
- Cancer.
- Yeah.

151
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,759
- Shit.
- Pancreatic.

152
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,518
Shit.

153
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,517
How far along?

154
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,232
With this kind, it doesn't really matter.

155
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,112
- [door creaks opens]
- Far enough.

Can we have the room?

158
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,429
Sorry?

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,709
Piss elsewhere.

? You're never gonna keep me down ?

? I get knocked down,
but I get up again ?

You should've come to me right away.

[door closes]

165

I've been, uh, you know,
letting it settle.

166

Kids know?

167
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,113
Not yet.

168
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,037
We'll access the best, most creative,

169
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,674
most forward-thinking
medical treatment there is.

170
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,916
You'll see my guy, Ari Gilbert--

171
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,632
top oncologist out there.

172
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,911
Works with select clients--
world leaders.

173
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,951
I've been funding his research for years.

174
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,071
Thank you for offering,
but you don't have to do that.

175
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,913
Stop. Stop. Stop.

176
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,150
It's what we do.

Get yourself together.

184
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,116
Come and see me at the end of the day.

185
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,514
I have a thought.

195
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,113
I'll help you.

197
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,471
? Parker Millsap's
"Heaven Sent" playing ?

198
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,309
? I tried my hardest not to be ?

199
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,672
? I locked the door, and I broke the key ?

200
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,634
? Why can 't I sleep through the night? ?

201
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,150
? Daddy, do you think I 've turned out... ?

202
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,317
How are you set financially?

203
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,317
Are Walter and the kids
gonna have enough?

204
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,954
Nobody's gonna starve,
but I could've done better.

205
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,479
[scoffs]

206
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,318
When I met Walter,

207
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,795
finally accepted who I am,

208
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,717
I felt so guilty about Karen.

209
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,637
I remember.
It was tough on both of you.

210
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,991
Yeah, so I kind of just gave her
everything.

211
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,678
Didn't shelter it or put it in a trust.

212
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,836
Just sort of heaved it over to her.

213
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,791
Practically started back at zero.

214
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,751
That's all chutes and ladders, isn't it?

215
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,950
- It sure is.
- [chuckles]

216
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,559
The guy she remarried--

217
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,159
he's got control of the money now,

218
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,192
and I can't be sure
what he's gonna do with it.

219
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,117
Emma and Harry are exposed?

220
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,468
Yeah.

221
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,431
What were you hoping to get to?

222
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,358
I-I don't have a number.

223
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,358
I just want them to be taken care of--

224
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,869
good education,
their first house, no debt.

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,151
Sure. Also, you want them
to be able to do what they want,

226
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,429
not what they have to.

227
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,079
Yeah.

228
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,636
Thought I was going to take care
of that in the next ten years.

229
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,194
Forty million.

230
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,596
What if we could get you there, pre-tax?

231
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,399
- For all the family?
- Big ladder.

232
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,636
But there's a way to make it happen,

233
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,716
to guarantee it.

234
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,796
Rewards of paradise here on Earth?

235
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,750
[chuckles]

236
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,029
Really sharp evangelists

237
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,071
could con me out of my house right now.

238
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,316
Unlike him,
I'm gonna give you the downside.

239
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,273
It won't be simple.
It'll require deception.

240
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,437
And your final weeks and months,
they won't be your own.

241
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,476
Are we talking about breaking the law?

242
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,070
Because l-I can't spend
one minute in jail.

243
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,236
Well, let's leave that to the lawyers.

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,238

Let me save you some breath.

255
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,596
Now, the Attorney General thinks it best

256
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,275
that my office
drop its pursuit of Axe Capital.

257
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,915
And you tried to argue with her,
but she was insistent.

258
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,190
Kids would hashtag that "1 00."

259
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,837
Any matter related to Axe Capital
is to be handled by the Eastern District

260
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,109
from here forward.

261
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,310
You know, the only thing I can't figure

262
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,954
is if the AG's fear of negative publicity

263
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,116
is because she's planning a Senate run

264
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,271
or a return to the private sector.

265
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,516
Put on a blindfold, spin yourself around,

266
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,108
and pin the tail on the donkey.

267
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,550
- You know?
- [chuckles] I do.

268
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,795
Defy her in any way,

269
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,791
she will recommend
that the President fire you.

270
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,315
And he will not hesitate
to take a recommendation.

271
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,839
I know.

272
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,872
And I would do the same thing
were I sitting in her office.

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,069
I accept it.

274
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,918
I am off Axelrod.

275
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,314

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,793
Good man.

277
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,117
But, you know, that is not

278
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,674
what you and I really need
to talk about today.

279
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,518
It's not?
[sighs]

280
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,312
Let's go out and take some air,

281
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,829
and I'll tell you why musical chairs

282
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,997
is a much better party game.

283
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,718
- Oh. Walter.
- Hey, Wendy.

284
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,353
[minister]
Friends...

285
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,950
Friends, may I ask that you
all please take your seats now?

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,199
Fuck.

287
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,558
Come on, I'll sit with you.

288
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,875
What are you doing here?

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,718
I came to pay my respects.

290
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,955
Not appropriate.

291
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,877
I knew the man.

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,798
Better than you let on, I'm sure.

293
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,273
Turn and leave.

294
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,193
Why would l?

296
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,631

Get the fuck out of here.

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,998
[scoffs]

298
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,599
All right.

299
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,155
It's a real loss.

300
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,432
Yeah...

301
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,313
for both of us.

302
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,478
[Bobby]
Those ungrateful fuckers

303
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,477
have to make me focus on this now?

304
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,955
[Wags] They hope you are
too distracted and sad

305
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,479
to focus on it at all.

306
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,478
Oh, I can still focus.
Talk.

307
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,319
So lonosphere Fund--
they set up shop downtown.

308
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,429
Carly's in charge?

309
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,790
Or Channing.
Definitely not Hlasa.

310
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,154
How much?

311
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,554
Two hundred million
under management, 40 of it's theirs.

312
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,908
Where's it coming from?

313
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,553
They stole this list.
Some of these people are ours.

314
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,835
Can we block that?

315
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,279
We absolutely could.

316
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,311
All three of them signed noncompetes.

317
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,078
But they can fight it,

318
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,478
claim that Axe Capital was no longer
the place they signed on to,

319
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,272
that their deals should be void.

320
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,668
They can't win, right?

321
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,997
Not likely, but with the current
sentiment, who knows?

322
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,793
And I don't think you want
that kind of attention right now.

323
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,516
No, but we can't have the perception
that the real talent at Axe Capital

324
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,153
is flying under a new flag.

325
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,111
Where you going?

326
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,593

I'm just asking.

332
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,034
- [clink]
- I'm just trying to warn you

333
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,832
that this lonosphere venture is doomed.

334
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,154
You trained these guys, right?

335
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,555
I taught 'em all they know,
not all I know.

336
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,795
[whirring]

337
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,399
But you extend them credit, it's on you.

338
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,794
It is.

339
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,239
I already have.

340
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,999
I'm first money in.
I got very favorable terms.

341
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,390
And I don't see a reason to give that up.

342
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,476
Do this for me,
and I'll cut your fees to one and ten

343
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,999
over the next three quarters.

344
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,394
I can't.

345
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,839
Check, sir.

346
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,235
[minister]
It is the love God has instilled in us

347
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,998
that has been our refuge,

348
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,032
that has sustained us for generations.

349
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,913
Before the mountains
were brought forth

350
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,874
or the Earth was born, there was love.

351
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,554
And it is love that turns us back to dust,

352
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,468
saying, "Go back, oh, child of Earth."

353
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,037
It is love that sweeps us away
like a dream.

354
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,555
[Orrin]
Your honor, our argument

355
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,477
is simple and straightforward.

356
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,273
My client provided
emergency medical care

357
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,753
to Christina Grunwald.

358
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,997
Mr. Stearn met the young lady's father,

359
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,429
Iearned of her desperate
medical condition,

360
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,599
had the resources
at his disposal to save her life,

361
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,034
and was moved to action.

362
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,870
I ask, uh, you to
look at this photograph

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,228
and tell me that,

364
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,114
if you were in a position
to save this child's life...

365
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,468
? serious music ?

366
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,636
...wouldn't you do it
just because you could?

367
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,909
???

368
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,874
Mr. Stearn had no idea
that medical treatment had any link

369
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,434
to alleged inside information.

370
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,879
[scoffs]

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,594
I ask you to consider the wisdom

372
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,713
of putting altruism itself on trial.

373
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,632
May l?

374
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,478
Mr. Connerty.

375
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,477
The people are fully prepared to prove

376
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,989
benefit was provided
in the form of medical expenses

377
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,190
to the tune of some $21 1,000.

378
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,995
And that as a direct response
to insider information

379
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,155
provided to Mr. Stearn.

380
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,157
Further, we can demonstrate

381
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,998
that Axe Capital used this information

382
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,795
to gain an $89 million profit,

383
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,789
an $89 million return...

384
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,394
...on a $21 1,000...

385
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,193
...investment.

386
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,678
Altruism is not on trial here,

387
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,713
but the fairness
of the financial markets is.

388
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,710
The U.S. Attorney's Office
has made a considered decision

389
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,516
to pursue and prosecute
precisely this new brand of criminal.

390
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,310
They are bastardizing the fair market
upon which this country is built.

391
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,993
Passionately executed, Mr. Connerty,

392
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,509
but the humane gesture
of providing medical treatment

393
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,871
for an afflicted child
as material benefit

394
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,230
begs that a jury learn the unknowable--

395
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,399
that is, what lay in Mr. Stearn's heart.

396
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,909
I deem it best that the court grants

397
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,719
defense counsel's motion for dismissal.

398
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,513
Your honor, I vigorously protest.

399
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,710
[Wilcox] Nonetheless,
my decision stands.

400
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,634
And I further advise
that you and the Southern District

401
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,031
reconsider the deployment
of government assets

402
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,277
in the settling of personal scores.

403
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,119
This session is adjourned.

404
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,150
[gavel bangs]

405
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,879
[sighs]

406
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,355
[both laugh]

407
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,118
[Chuck]
He said "personal scores"?

408
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,559
He used those words?

409
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,513
- Direct quote.
- [scoffs]

410
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,232
Motherfucker.

411
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,636
How goddamn comfortable
in your seat do you have to be to do that?

412
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,116
[breathes deeply]

413
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,118
Should we start clearing
the Axelrod files or...?

414
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,435
Tomorrow.

415
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,677
What you need to do now
is take the day, at least.

416
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,990
- But come back ready to go.
- I can hang in here--

417
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,633
Go!

418
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,273
Breathe in some fall air.

419
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,150
I'd like to imagine someone
is doing that today.

420
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,679
It might as well be you.

421
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,314
[scoffs]
I bet "Dollar" Bill is doing exactly that

422
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,550
with a giant fucking smile on his face.

423
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,071
What are you gonna do?

424
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,316
Well, we've lost the Axe case.

425
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,557
Wilcox cut the "Dollar" Bill thread.

426
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,830
So we need to get circular
with our thinking...

427
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,590
...turn the impediments
into our own blockers.

428
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,239
[sighs]

429
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,272
Don't worry.
I know what I'm talking about.

430
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,839
[telephone ringing in the distance]

431
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,679
- He wanted to see me?
- He did, but not right now.

432
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,314
This about those lonosphere traitors?

433
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,510
Quislings?

434
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,995
Don't answer that.

435
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,678
[exhales deeply]
So, Deb...

436
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,869
Don't.

437
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,355
[sighs] I make stupid money,
and I'm ready for a relationship.

438
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,516
I make plenty,
and I'm out of your league.

439
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,392
You're right.

440
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,988
Guys around here avoid you
like you're a dangerous fighter,

441
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,354
because you're a triple threat--

442
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,199
power, speed, and footwork.

443
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,117
So give me some credit for stepping up.

444
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,151
Credit for the honesty.

445
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,436
If you have dinner with me,
I'll buy you a Mini Cooper.

446
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,516
- [chuckles]
- Oh, see?

447
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,119
See?
You smiled.

448
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,198
And you know and I know that a smile

449
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,630
is a gateway
to multiple convulsive orgasms.

450
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,115
I smiled because I'm too long for a Mini,

451
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,878
and you almost look cute
when you're nervous.

452
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,353
[Bobby]
Hey, Mafee, get in here.

453
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,316
Go on in.

454
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,553
[employees chanting]
Keyser, Keyser, Keyser, Keyser,

455
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,196
Keyser, Keyser, Keyser, Keyser...

456
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,511
- [Bill] Thank you.
- Keyser, Keyser, Keyser...

457
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,789
[laughing]

458
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,831
- Thank you!
- [laughs]

459
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,394
- Keyser, Keyser...
- Thank you, my children.

460
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,112
Bill Stearn!

461
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,832
I'm back, baby!

462
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,515
Get your ass in my office right now.

463
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,512
[employees murmuring]

464
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,356
Close the fucking door.

465
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,754
Um, you want to tell me what I did here?

466
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,950
Pretend we're having an argument.

467
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,958
? Parker Millsap's
"Quite Contrary" playing ?

468
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,550
???

469
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,193
You want to fucking tell me why?

470
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,959
I want the Street to think
that you and I are on the outs!

471
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,799
I especially want those fuckers
who left to hear about it!

472
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,469
? Quite contrary, how'd you get your... ?

473
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,037
I want to give Channing, Carly,
and Hlasa a good fucking!

474
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,196
I heard they went out on their own!
You didn't bless that?

475
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,715
- I did not bless that at all.
- That's a shame!

476
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,796
They were talented,
and I kind of liked them!

477
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,069
Oh, so you don't want to help me out?

478
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,949
Fuck that! They fuck you,
they fuck me, so let's fuck them!

479
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,235
What do you want me to do?

480
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,316
I'm gonna poke you.
Poke me back.

481
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,715
I'll poke you all goddamn day.

482
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,796
???

483
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,315
You throw in with them,
you tell them I was a prick,

484
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,238
but you stuck your neck out--
more to come.

485
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,475
Got it!

486
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,989
You've been through a lot.
You all right?

487
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,395
It was hell, but I survived!

488
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,112
When you walk out that door,

489
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,516
I want you to tell me to go fuck myself,
good and loud!

490
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,517
They're gonna hear me
in the back office!

491
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,791
Come bonus time,
I am gonna show you enough love,

492
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,353
you could start a third family!

493
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,959
Two's fucking plenty!

494
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,832
- I'm gonna shove you now!
- Go ahead!

495
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,188
? Oh ?

496
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,594
[whispering]
I love you like a brother.

497
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,952
? All torn down ?

498
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,838
I fucking love you, too, man.

499
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,794
???

500
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,313
Fuck.

501
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,434
???

502
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,796
Go fuck yourself, Axelrod!

503
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,196
???

504
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,639
[door closes]

[indistinct conversations]

506
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,156
[minister]
And now let us take a moment

507
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,876
to appreciate the beauty of nature,
which Donnie loved so well.

508
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,632
[leaves rustling]

509
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,434
Amen.

510
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,391
[all]
Amen.

511
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,991
And now, according to Donnie's wishes,
we drink and have a good time.

512
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,759
- [all chuckle]
- Walter...

513
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,475
[sniffles and sighs]

514
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,471
Donnie said,

515
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,916
and I'm quoting here...

516
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,589
"Have them all bury my picture
in autumn leaves,

517
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,996
and as they do,

518
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,918
they should make a wish for the world...

519
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,759
that has nothing to do
with the financial markets."

520
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,235
[laughter]

521
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,272
? gentle acoustic guitar music ?

522
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,394
???

523
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,788
The paint was about
eight layers thick and hard,

524
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,955
but I scratched it.

525
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,274
And beneath the layers?

526
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,118
Wilcox, greasy muck on his shoes.

527
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,389
Talk to me.

528
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,949
Well, I looked at his sentencing history,

529
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,470
and about seven years ago,
there's a significant pattern shift.

530
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,478
Suddenly, he becomes the toughest
hanging judge on the federal bench,

531
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,477
but not on white-collar crime.

532
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,160
- Oh, no?
- No, not on white of any kind.

533
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,952
He lets the white guys skate

534
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,953
if he thinks you have access
to lawyers or press

535
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,314
or other noisemakers.

536
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,000
But poor black and Latino boys
from the hood

537
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,155
get slapped with all kinds of time.

538
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,317
Uh-huh. Now, is that racism,
or is there money somewhere?

539
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,192
Well, I did a deep dive
on his financial history,

540
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,551
and seven years ago,
he joined an investment group.

541
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,233
One of their holdings--

542
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,717
Baldinger Prison Systems,
a privatized for-profit prison company.

543
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,593
They charge inmates a dollar a minute
to use the phone...

544
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,550
[chuckles]

545
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,956
...and then soak the government
with a 300% markup.

546
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,959
They net $1 7,000 a year per prisoner.

547
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,275
Wilcox is building his business
from the bench.

548
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,914
- Exactly.
- And he's doing it to poor kids...

549
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,554
with public defenders
who are far less likely to file an appeal

550
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,671
and far less able to win one.

551
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,518
Jesus Christ.

552
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,153
Where is the money going?

553
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,636
It bounces into the Caymans,
but it winds up in Dominican,

554
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,159
where he has a condo.

555
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,838
[scoffs]

556
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,188
This is great work.

557
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,232
And he's fucking
his Dominican housekeeper.

558
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,869
I'm gonna get you back
from Eastern and make you happy.

559
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,877
- I'd like to be happy.

Fuck. Really?

565
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,997
Pretty grown-up, huh?

566
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,908
If I live to 1 00,
I wouldn't be this grown-up.

567
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,031
[scoffs]

568
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,394
You want anything?

569
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,233
I'm fine.
Thanks.

570
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,392
This isn't from lkea, is it?

571
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,078
No.

572
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,914
But it works the same way.

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,390
? Men were made to talk ?

578
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,114
? Babies born to cry ?

00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,708
? Tears will make 'em tall ?

580

? The fear of God gets in their eyes ?

? Sticks and stones ?

? But words will make... ?

Dad.

586
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,830
What are you doing here?

587
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,315
I was going through some things,

588
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,273
and I came across this.

589
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,960
It's your lndian Head penny collection.

590
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,150
Thought you might get a kick out of it.

591
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,350
You came all the way out
to Brooklyn to give me

592
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,629
my penny collection?

593
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,116
No, I'm meeting Perry and Richie
at Luger's later.

594
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,636
I thought, as long as I'm over here...

595
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,508
Oh, fuck it.

596
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,676
This isn't the year
that I start choosing my words

597
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,518
to avoid offense.

598
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,596
Just when I got my hopes up.

599
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,439
Okay, you want delicate?
How about this?

600
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,120
Perhaps it's time to be more careful

601
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,834
about how you process and react.

602
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,679
It's a critical time.

603
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,630
[clears throat]

604
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,955
And here's the less delicate way--

605
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,038
stop fucking up!

606
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,071
[book thuds]

607
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,872
Insightful.

608
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,672
This must be how Ali felt

609
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,598
when Angelo Dundee
whispered in his ear.

610
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,678
Do you know what the press
is saying about you?

611
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,836
Didn't bother checking.
I have a general idea.

612
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,997
Well, they are clubbing you
like a baby seal.

613
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,549
It's time that you got out
in front of this.

614
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,999
- [sighs]
- You are a target

615
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,236
for the Attorney General now.

616
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,510
Maybe it's time you got out of there...

617
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,358
- [sighs]
-...before you get fired.

618
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,072
And do what?
Hmm?

619
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,838
Go over to Horvath?

620
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,790
Maybe I get on my hands and knees
and crawl up to Westport,

621
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,629
drum up some business defending Bobby
Axelrod or his friends, huh?

622
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,593
I didn't show up here
with just my rod in my hand.

623
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,358
No, you brought coins.
[chuckles]

624
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,273
And I have an idea.

625
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,158
Go ahead.

626
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,595
Take a year off.

627
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,717
Move the family up to the farm.

628
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,989
Mount Kisco?

629
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,912
It's beautiful.

630
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,354
Wendy can open a practice.

631
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,313
God knows there are plenty
of bored housewives

632
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,192
that could use her help.

633
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,710
And you write a book.

634
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,791
In no time,

635
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,196
you will have established residency.

636
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,153
Ahh.

637
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,829
Patrick Esposito's congressional seat.

638
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,393
Oh.

639
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,471
- Patrick is tired.
- [sighs]

640
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,636
I talked to him.

641
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,876
He'll step aside.
You'll be a shoo-in.

642
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,958
Congress.

643
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,718
Boy, that sounds like fun--

645
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,868
some of whom even believe in science.

646
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,230
Well, you'll stand out.

647
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,791
You know, if you had listened
to me in the first place

648
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,791
and hadn't blown up the deal
with Axelrod,

649
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,996
we would not be in this spot, would we?

650
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,156
[laughs]

651
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,831
"We"?

652
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,679
No, you don't get to do that,

653
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,597
not anymore.

654
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,359
Let me be delicate now.

655
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,069
The game has changed,
and you haven't changed with it.

656
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,668
Your advice is no longer welcome.

657
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,075
So the next time
you want to waltz in here

658
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,559
with your "l told you so" routine,

659
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,638
do us both a favor and stay the fuck out.

660
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,751
[book slams]

661
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,833
[beep, whirring loudly]

662
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,950
Four-million-dollar rip on DKA,
up two percent in our first week.

663
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,038
There are tips, and there are tips.

664
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,798
You plan on telling us where you got it?

665
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,275
You'll hear the next one yourself.

666
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,078
He's here.

667
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,555
[Carly]
"Dollar" Bill, Mr. Hundred Cent.

668
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,319
Billy Buck Buck, motherfucker!

669
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,316
I should've known.

670
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,476
Everyone's been talking
about your brawl with Axe.

671
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,875
[groans]
Fucking prick.

672
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,998
I keep my mouth shut,
risk doing time for him,

673
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,712
and then he treats me like that.

674
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,592
- [slaps leg]
- [Carly sighs]

675

- [groans]
- [grunts]

676
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,676
Look at this.

677
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,353
Little shop that could.

678
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,153
[sighs]
And from the acorn grew the mighty oak.

679
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,919
No doubt, all-star team like this.

680
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,031
[Channing]
Could always use one more.

681
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,276
Champagne?

682
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,833
I'll take one of those Heinekens.

683
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,951
[bottles clink]

684
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,432
- [bottle cap clatters]
- What do you say?

685
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,028
We can talk after the first of the year.

686
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,390
I am contractually owed a bonus.

687
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,430
[chuckles]

688
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,118
Meantime, want some more candy?

689
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,434
Yeah.

690
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,553
You know how Penn Consol's
been rising on takeover rumors?

691
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,113
I've been watching that.

692
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,959
Behind the scenes,
there's a bidding war.

693
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,355
It is fucking on.

694
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,879
You sure?

695
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,514
I am not uncertain.

696
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,950
[laughter, glasses clink]

697
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,479
[knock on door]

698
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,750
- Come on in, Chuck. Sit down.
- [door opens]

699
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,950
I can deliver this on my feet.

700
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,115
[door closes]

701
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,077
Know that if this urgent meeting

702
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,073
is to slam me for my ruling
on the William Stearn case,

703
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,595
you should proceed
to the other side of that door

704
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,551
and tell it to the doorknob.

705
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,716
Whit, that's a closed case.

706
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,796
Forget "Dollar" Bill Stearn.

707
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,316
No, this is about Daquan Forrester.

708
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,476
You remember Daquan--
the first-offender kid dealing pot

709
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,114
he bought in New Jersey
his senior year of high school

710
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,913
that you slapped with 1 5 years.

711
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,792
What about him?

712
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,512
It's about Julio Lopez.

713
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,238
Remember him, too?

714
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,510
Eleven years for credit card fraud

715
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,949
because he bought a PlayStation?

716
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,308
? tense music ?

717
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,436
This won't do anyone any good.

718
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,154
Some of those are your cases,
your office.

719
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,153
How did I miss it for so long?

720
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,915
You know, all those middle-class types
walking out of your courtroom free.

721
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,998
All those black and Latino kids
going upstate for 20 years.

722
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,752
I am no racist.

723
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,711
Oh, no. [chuckles]
That's selling you short.

724
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,638
You're worse--a racist and a profiteer.

725
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,159
???

726
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,475
You want proof?
Wait for it.

727
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,272
[clicks tongue]

728
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,358
Baldinger Prison Systems.

729
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,994
???

730
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,839
There's no way to reopen those cases.

731
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,951
I can draw a straight line
to you and your partners,

732
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,116
your offshore bank account,

733
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,879
and even your little girlfriend,
Maribel Solarte,

734
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,309
at your condo in Punta Cana.

735
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,590
Theories and accusations.

736
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,280
After I spent a lifetime on the bench...

737
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,676
until I got splinters
in my ass and all for...

738
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,870
a civil servant's wages.

739
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,834
We both know they're not
just accusations, Your Honor.

740
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,994
???

741
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,154
What do you want?

742
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,430
You will resign immediately

743
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,233
for undisclosed personal reasons.

744
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,390
And there will be a little party
and tearful good-byes,

745
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,990
and you will stride off
into private practice.

746
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,671
Or the FBl can come in here
and give you a far different reception.

747
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,870
???

748
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,434
You...

749
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,913
- won't prosecute?
- No.

750
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,553
You do it that way,

751
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,399
and the Southern District
declines to prosecute.

752
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,078
[scoffs] Because if we did,
you would dig

753
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,875
those badger teeth and claws
of yours in and fight.

754
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,753
It would take two years,
and you would go to jail,

755
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,071
but the Southern District believes
that your swift departure

756
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,919
would be best for the justice system.

757
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,273
Oh...

758
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,550
???

759
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,790
And shame on you.

760
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,718
???

761
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,150

Hi.

766
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,873
- [sighs]
- How you holding up?

767
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,315
[smooches, sniffles]

768
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,238
Funeral arrangements
were a welcome distraction.

769
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,473
I brought a casserole,
just like it was the '50s.

770
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,839
This Secret Santa project
looks overwhelming.

771
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,791
- [dish clatters]
-Do you need a hand?

772
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,876
Help is literally on the way.

773
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,991
Lara's taking over
the whole operation.

774
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,678
Oh.
So good of her.

775
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,677
She's been great.

776
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,519
Both of them, really great.

777
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,309
You're in a complicated position.

778
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,670
[inhales deeply]
Yeah.

779
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,030
It was hard on Donnie,

780
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,991
not being able to tell you.

781
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,509
- What do you mean?
- [footsteps approaching]

782
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,235
I just mean his privacy, you know...

783
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,113
it meant a lot to him.

784
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,276
Did other people know?

785
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,836
Hey.

786
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,598
I've got a big truck outside.

787
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,514
- Oh, do you need me to move?
- If you wouldn't mind.

788
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,677
It's so good of you to take over
the Secret Santa thing.

789
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,633
Yeah.
We were pretty close.

790
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,753
And closer in troubled times--
that's the true test of friendship.

791
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,552
Yes, it is.

792
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,830
What are you doing here?

793
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,110
I'm saying hi to Walter,

794
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,390
seeing if he needed anything.

795
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,397
He's taken care of.

796
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,556
I see.

797
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,474
Well, I figure, at a time like this,
the more, the merrier.

798
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,393
At a time like this,
a family pulls together.

799
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,313
That's what Axe Capital is--a family.

800
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,072
One I'm part of, too.

801
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,270
Of course you are.

802
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,038
We're fine.

803
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,477
Thanks for the casserole.

804
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,356

"Heaven Sent" playing ?

806
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,269
? I tried my hardest not to be ?

807
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,110
? I locked the door, and I broke the key ?

808
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,277
? Why can 't I sleep through the night? ?

809
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,833
Want company?

810
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,872
No.
I 'd be no good.

811
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,639
All right.

812
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,512
You okay?

813
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,709
Sure.

814

???

815
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,228
You and Donnie were close,

816
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,590
especially these last few months.

817
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,990
? I just want to make... ?

818
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,789
How long you figure it's been
since we've had a session?

819
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,633
- We talk all the time.
- No, a real session.

820
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,991
? Say that it's a sin,
it's how I've always been ?

821
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,838
? Did you love me when... ?

822
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,349
Three and a half years.

823
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,836
?... he was just my friend? ?

824
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,713
[chuckles]

825
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,398
Will you come see me?

826
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,949
? Ah ?

827
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:11,998
? Ooh, ooh ?

828
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,398
???

829
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,990
? Papa, you're the one that taught me ?

830
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,310
? By his strap, he sought me ?

831
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,352
? And with his blood, he bought me ?

832
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,436
- [rustling]
- ? Daddy ?

833
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,232
? You're the one that claimed that ?

834
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,476
? He loved me through the flame ?

835
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,114
? Now why can 't you do the same? ?

836
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,038
- [rustling continues]
- ? Well, I've been born again ?

837
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,912
? First was born in sin ?

838
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,555
? Did you love me then? ?

839
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,114
- [door closes]
- ? Did you love me then? ?

840
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,468
[Bobby]
Hey.

841
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,511
Christmas coming
a little early this year?

842
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,359
This is Donnie's Secret Santa project.

843
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,549
I took it on.

844
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,955
- We're elves.
- Slave elves.

845
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,559
Gordie.

846
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,116
Pretty big job here, boys.
You want some help?

847
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,389
What are you doing?

848
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,919
I'll get a half a dozen interns
from the office.

849
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,878
They'll knock this off in no time.
They're lvy Leaguers.

850
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,314
- Yes.
- Conference.

851
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,396
You two keep wrapping.

852
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,909
Remember, there are more presents
in the other room.

853
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,509
This is one of those teachable moments
that we talked about.

854
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,392
The idea is that we do something
with our own hands

855
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,318
to benefit the less fortunate,
as a family.

856
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,238
Is this a teachable moment
for me or for the kids?

857
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,191
[sighs]

858
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,070
All right, I'll wrap.

859
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,918
And, Bobby...

860
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,679
- I ran into Wendy at Walter's today.
- And?

861
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,075
She was probing Walter for information.

862
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,754
Is that right?

863
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,394
It made be wonder
about her continuing value.

864
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,636
You know, we're vulnerable,
and so are they.

865
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,270
I trust her.

866
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,517
[indistinct conversations, laughter]

867
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,914
- Mm.
- [chuckles]

868
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,553
Thank you.

869
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,671
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.

870
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,831
- Mm.
- You didn't have to come.

871
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,439
Oh, of course I did.

872
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,391
Wouldn't be seemly otherwise.

873
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,239
Boy, you know what I love
about this cake?

874
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,032
- What?
- Sour cream.

875
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,628
It's just like my grandmother
used to make.

876
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,273
Gives it a little...

877
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,475
tang.

878
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,397
- Yes, it does.
- Yeah.

879
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,637
You like a little tang
every so often, don't you, Whit?

880
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,910
- Sure, Chuck.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

881
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,235
It's a really nice crowd.

882
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,318
- I think I'll say a few words.
- No, that won't be necessary.

883
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,759
I move to speak.

884
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,472
Uh...

885
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,273
- Ladies and gentlemen?
- [bottle clinking]

886
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,518
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention for a moment?

887
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,949
Thank you.

888
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,991
[chuckles]

889
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,270
Justice...

890
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,995
rooted in truth, watered by tenacity,

891
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,795
and flowering in wisdom--

892
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,755
may be the single most beautiful
expression of humanity.

893
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,911
And for a man to dedicate his life
in its pursuit

894
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,429
rings of a certain...

895
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,835
nobility.

896
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,475
And this day we gather
to acknowledge that nobility

897
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,435
in the Honorable Whit Wilcox...

898
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,436
[inhales deeply]

899
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,109
...devoted servant of justice

900
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,234
and one of its most industrious sentinels.

901
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,959
Congratulations, Judge Wilcox.

902
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,038
And thank you for your noble service.

903
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,116
Mm.

904
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,276
? For... ?

905
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,635
[all]
? He's a jolly good fellow ?

906
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,676
? For he's a jolly good fellow ?

907
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,950
? Which nobody can... ?

908
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,395
[singing fades]

909
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,158
Hello, Judge.

910
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,475
You're going to jail.

911
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,919
You may even own it.

912
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,756
[under breath]
You're a fucking liar.

913
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,791
I said the Southern District
wouldn't prosecute.

914
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,672
I can't speak for Eastern.

915
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,234
- You'll be coming with us.
- [all murmuring]

916
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,759
[man]
You have the right to remain silent.

917
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,155
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

918
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,554
in a court of law.

919
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,433
Twenty-eight percent
of our goddamn fund

920
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,915
by the time we dug ourselves
out of the position.

921
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,429
Was there ever even a real takeover
being considered?

922
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,916
[scoffs]
Who cares? It's over.

923
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,393
[elevator clangs to a stop]

924
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,875
How are we gonna explain
this to our investors?

925
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,388
[Bobby]
Nice space.

926
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,078
Edgy.

927
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,197
Mind if I take a seat?

928
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,596
[breathes deeply]

929
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,716
Going forward,
you might want to consider

930
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,796
vetting your information a little better.

931
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,433
Lesson learned.

932
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,790
[sighs]

933
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,390
I could take pleasure
in watching you three circle the drain,

934
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,357
but I am a practical man.

935
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,636
And there was a reason
that I hired and trained all of you

936
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,875
in the first place.

937
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,911
So...

938
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,190
here's what I'm prepared to do.

939
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,351
I will seed lonosphere--

940
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,471
stupid fucking name, by the way--

941
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,070
with $250 million.

942
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,634
That should keep the lights on.

943
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,159
You'll be required to sign

944
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,669
noncompete
and non-solicitation agreements.

945
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,349
We will enter
into a revenue-share agreement.

946
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,075
The current rate for seed money
is 20% to 25%,

947
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,872
so why don't we call it 40%?

948
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,149
Forty?

949
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,397
Swallow that and wash it down with this.

950
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,829
You will provide total transparency.

951
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,111
I want your trade files
sent to my office every night.

952
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,832
There will be a limit

953
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,157
on how much outside capital
you can raise.

954
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,470
At no time can you manage

955
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,592
more than $999 million.

956
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,869
- [sighs]
- [scoffs]

957
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,276
There will be no buyout to eliminate
the revenue-share agreement

958
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,072
and no lockup on my money.

959
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,158
I can pull the plug at any time.

960
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,113
That's the deal, no negotiation.

961
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,791
I'm counting to five,
and then it's off the table.

962
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,195
- One...
- We'll do it.

963
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,518
? pensive music ?

964
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,755
???

965
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,552
Wise.

966
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,797
???

967
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,070
And I better see you at the funeral.

968
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,228
???

969
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,590
[scoffs]

970
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,150
- [bottle thuds]
- [sighs heavily]

971
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,918
I, uh--I don't go to funerals.

972
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,434
I can't bring myself to.
I-I skip 'em.

973
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,149
I send mountains of flowers
and food to the wake,

974
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,352
convince myself
that's the right thing to do.

975
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,590
If I were asked why, I'd say,

976
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,870
"Well, we want to remember him
how he was,"

977
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,719
or some other bullshit.

978
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,072
Truth?

979
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,879
I like to keep moving
so I don't have to think about it.

980
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,592
More truth?

981
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,280
I'm not the type to grapple with it all.

982
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,594
But...

983
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,551
...there was no way
that I was gonna skip this one...

984
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,077
...because Donnie...

985
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,759
...grappled with all of it.

986
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,593
He was courage...

987
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,640
...and hope.

988
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,590
And his intelligence and his kindness
made me want to be all those things, too,

989
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,631
as it did all of you.

990
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,876
I am so angry that he's gone...

991
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,195
...so glad that while he was here...

992
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,235
I was one of the lucky few
who knew him.

993
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,275
I admired Donnie Caan.

994
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,310
And I am proud
to have called him a friend.

995
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,989
[wind blowing]

996
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,755
[grunts]
Let's do this.

997
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,996
Donnie.

998
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,473
[all]
To Donnie.

999
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,318
[Bryan]
Why you working from home today?

1000
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,194
I went to a funeral and got kicked out...

1001
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,833
by my wife.

1002
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,713
I needed the quiet.
[sighs]

1003
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,949
The Judge Wilcox arrest...

1004
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,433
Mm-hmm?

1005
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,551
- Slick move.
- Mm.

1006
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,914
[both chuckle softly]

1007
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,359
That wasn't it.

1008
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,993
It was just the opener, right?

1009
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,077
You got rid of an impediment,
but that's not enough.

1010
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,589
You're putting in your own blocker.

1011
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,712
You want to put someone in that seat--

1012
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,910
someone who'll owe you,
not someone who's compromised,

1013
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,874
just a more willing ear.

1014
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,238
[chuckles]

1015
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,793
The person needs to be qualified.

1016
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,990
He or she needs to check out...

1017
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,236
gold stars across the board.

1018
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,713
[sighs]

1019
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,279
It's a Senate appointment,
the Judiciary committee,

1020
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,030
so it won't be immediate,
but it won't be long either.

1021
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,958
Yeah, you're almost there.

1022
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,638
Hmm.

1023
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,191
Adam DeGiulio?

1024
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,077
And then he's out of your way
at the AG's office, too.

1025
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,637
And maybe he leaves a friendly
behind in his place.

1026
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,273
Wow.

1027
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,392
Don't get too excited
by how good it sounds.

1028
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,637
Everything's got to fall just right.
[chuckles]

1029
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,909
And the odds of that happening--

1030
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,878
Still, you're playing the game again,
clear-eyed.

1031
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,712
Oh, that I am.

1032
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,119
Drink?

1033
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,434
No.

1034
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,710
I'll--I'll keep mine clear, too.

1035
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,158
You all right?

1036
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,878
Sad.

1037
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,151
Yeah.
He was a good guy...

1038
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,748
one of the few people at work
who was remotely interesting.

1039
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,518
Tell me about it.

1040
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,318
And...

1041
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,158
he was our gay guy.

1042
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,630
That make a difference?

1043
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,352
Yeah.

1044
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,358
These days, it's great to have a gay.

1045
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,432
You are a complete goddamn animal.

1046
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,798
I ruined his life.

1047
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,309
- Say again?
- [inhales deeply]

1048
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,839
Donnie.

1049
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,633
I was able to patch him up,

1050
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,433
keep him in a game
that made him miserable.

1051
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,033
If I just...

1052
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,390
Iet him fail, get fired,
he would've been better off.

1053
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,112
He could've made the life he wanted.

1054
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,468
That's kind of a stretch, Wendy.

1055
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,149
Oh, he would've been so much happier
if he'd returned to academia.

1056
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,429
Give me a break.

1057
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,155
College professors are broke as fuck
and bitter, too.

1058
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,316
They certainly don't leave
40 mil to their families

1059
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,271
when they knock off.

1060
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,119
Now, what...
[sighs]

1061
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,870
...is really going on, Dr. Rhoades?

1062
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,195
Is it a little case of projection?

1063
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,390
Donnie walked with 40?

1064
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,080
Hyperbole.

1065
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,117
Just making my point.

1066
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,879
Right.

1067
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,600
Worst part of my job, I'll tell you that.

1068
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,518
- Ari.
- Hey, Bobby.

1069
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,110
Thank you, Dr. Gilbert,
for the excellent care,

1070
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,992
for trying so hard.

1071
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,708
Walter, we're gonna take off.

1072
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,114
[sighs]

1073
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,800
A messenger's gonna stop by tomorrow.

1074
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,592
You'll have all the info.

1075
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,631
Any problems,
you have the number, right?

1076
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,591
Yes.

1077
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,153
Thank you.

1078
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,914
I should be thanking you.

1079
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,270
I took him away from you.

1080
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,553
He should've been
with his family, with you.

1081
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,956
No, you pulled him out of a dark well,

1082
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,469
made him himself again,

1083
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,352
got him reaching
for that final piece of life

1084
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,278
instead of watching it go.

1085
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,276
[chuckles]

1086
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,719
Oh, honey.

1087
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,758
It was a good send-off.

1088
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,235
[sniffles]
It was very Donnie.

1089
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,793
[all chuckle]

1090
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,638
[sniffles]

1091
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,194
So nothing to worry about
on the Secret Santa front.

1092
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,430
I really couldn't have that
around the house.

1093
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,755
Donnie loved doing it so much.
[chuckles]

1094
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,031
He kept saying,
"l just want to make it to Christmas

1095
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,636
so I can be Santa one more time."

1096
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,034
He'd see them get the gifts

1097
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,277
and beam straight through New Year's.

1098
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,319
He just didn't make it.

1099
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,829
Okay.

1100
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,870
I'll meet you in the waiting room.

1101
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,228
Okay.

1102
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,433
[door creaks]

1103
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,871
Ari?
How is he?

1104
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,150
It's not contained,
and it's spreading quickly.

1105
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,436
I'm not into the calendar game, but...

1106
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,629
two, three months.

1107
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,076
That's a shame.

1108
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,753
He is a candidate
for a drug trial in Pittsburgh

1109
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,838
that's been yielding
some pretty interesting results.

1110
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,359
Such as?

1111
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,278
Slowing growth down,
buying time, really.

1112
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,674
How much?

1113
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,878
Three or four months more, six.

1114
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,991
I can get him in,

1115
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,839
but it is a pretty rigorous course.

1116
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,795
So...

1117
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,195
kind of rough for a guy
who's been through a lot already.

1118
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,072
It can be.

1119
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,034
Maybe we shouldn't bring it up.

1120
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,355
You think?
Uh...

1121
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,314
Well, I mean, what kind of quality of life
would he have?

1122
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,750
Best not to bring it up, then.

1123
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,510
- [door opens]
- Yeah.
