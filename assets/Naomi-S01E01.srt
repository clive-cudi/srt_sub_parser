1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,440
We all look at the world
through our own lens.

2
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:07,616
But looking isn't
the same thing as seeing.

3
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:11,098
What if everything you believed about
the world turned out to be wrong?

4
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:15,189
If we truly opened up our eyes,
what would we see?

5
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:19,541
Every superhero has an origin
story, and this is mine.

6
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:41,041
- Hey, Naomi!
- Hey!

7
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,825
Naomi!

8
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,585
Hey, Naomi, thanks for the AP Lit notes.
Girl, you saved my life.

9
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:47,264
- Anytime, lady. Dostoevsky is no joke.
- Right.

10
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:48,874
Oh!

11
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,093
Damn, Naomi.

12
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:52,748
Nice reflexes.
You want to join the team?

13
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,098
Will we finally win a game?

14
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:58,319
Yo, cameo time.

15
00:00:58,362 --> 00:00:59,972
You guys, check this out.

16
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,759
Naomi runs the number three
Superman fan site in the world.

17
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:05,935
Not for long. Brazil site
is number one,

18
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:08,590
and the Philippines is number
two, but I'm coming for them.

19
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:16,337
For someone so fly, you sure
are into some nerdy stuff.

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,817
Mmm-hmm. I'm just saying.

21
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:22,299
Superman? The guy
wears a cape and spandex.

22
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:24,388
One or the other, acceptable.

23
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,390
Both together? I mean, come on.

24
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,175
- Not the coolest.
- Incorrect.

25
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:30,220
The verycoolest.

26
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:33,876
Who can shoot laser beams from
his frickin' eyes? His eyes, man.

27
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:40,143
But the best part? He's adopted,

28
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,449
which means he's extra-special,

29
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:44,321
'cause adopted kids are chosen,
just like me.

30
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,806
- But also, he's not real. Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm!

31
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:56,159
So? Einstein said,
"Reality is merely an illusion,

32
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:59,075
albeit a persistent one."

33
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,250
It was in our AP reading.

34
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:01,793
Do you actually
take the class, Nathan,

35
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,906
or you just sit there
and look pretty?

36
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,170
You think I'm pretty?

37
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:10,260
- Annabelle.
- OMG.

38
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,412
Babe, you're like, four hours late.
Where have you been?

39
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:16,397
You know my parents and their
firm stance on family dinner.

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,836
- I thought this was ginger ale.
- I'm on it, hon.

41
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,360
- Nathan sure knows
how to throw a party,

42
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,102
and look damn, damn good
while doing it.

43
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,845
Damn good.

44
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:31,542
I hadn't noticed.

45
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:34,197
Right, because you broke up
with that fine specimen of a man

46
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,329
after five dates?

47
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,548
I don't know what
you're talking about.

48
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,203
This is my jam.

49
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,163
Yeah, Naomi!

50
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,230
Ready for the delegation,

51
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:10,190
but we're only one stop on their
tour and he's making us crazy.

52
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,409
Hey. Morning, pumpkin.

53
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:15,456
- Morning.
- Honestly, it's only two lines.

54
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:17,240
Hello. It's a pleasure
to meet you.

55
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,850
How hard is that?

56
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,375
- I am a linguist, not a miracle worker.
- Bonjour.

57
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:34,475
Hello. It's a pleasure
to meet you.

58
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:37,260
That... That's my girl. Up top.

59
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,480
Dad.

60
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:41,656
What?

61
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:45,703
Now high fives are out?

62
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:49,272
Yes, like ten years ago.

63
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:52,144
I like that better anyway.

64
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:54,297
I didn't hear you come in last night.
What time did you get home?

65
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,192
I don't know. Midnight.

66
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:59,630
Hmm, midnight.

67
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:03,591
Yeah, I haven't stayed out
that late since 2009.

68
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:06,420
We drove to Portland,
we saw Coldplay.

69
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,944
- Remember, Jen?
- Gosh. I sure do.

70
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:10,859
We got our groove on.

71
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,470
Yeah. Yeah, we did.
You still got your groove on.

72
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,385
Oh, you know I do.

73
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:18,823
It's a little early
for all of that, folks.

74
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,131
Better hurry. Bell rings in 15.

75
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:25,003
If you let me get a car, you wouldn't
have to worry about me being late.

76
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,354
Nice try. No driving
until graduation.

77
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:28,957
Then these are
the only wheels I've got.

78
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,514
Anthony? Hey.

79
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:42,957
Missed you last night. I thought
you were coming to the party.

80
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,869
Your boy gave me
the wrong address.

81
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,523
That's not how you treat people.

82
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,003
I'm sure it was a mistake.

83
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,528
Come on. Why would Nathan
give you the wrong address?

84
00:05:54,571 --> 00:06:00,272
Military brats like him, they
hate townies like me. It's...

85
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,797
- They always have.
- It's a two-way street.

86
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,626
Most townies aren't
so welcoming to new kids.

87
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:10,152
Also, I'm a military brat
and I don't hate you.

88
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:13,895
Yeah, but you're... you.

89
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:22,643
- So...
- I'll see you in debate club after school.

90
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,993
Okay, so here's
how this is going to work.

91
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,690
Commander's giving us
15 minutes...

92
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,779
That's not enough time
for a real debate.

93
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:31,347
Well, it's not a real debate.

94
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,436
Our club has been chosen
to represent the school

95
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,439
by presenting to the visiting
military delegation.

96
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,528
Now, are we ready to begin?

97
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,362
What's going on?

98
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,526
Annabelle says there's a
stunt happening in the square.

99
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:52,542
Something to do
with... Superman.

100
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:55,850
I need this for my site.

101
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,242
Bathroom break. Ten minutes.

102
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:58,287
I'll be right back.

103
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,998
What happened? Where did he go?

104
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,874
It was like a scene
out of a movie.

105
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,833
Sixty-five years on this Earth,

106
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,269
I've never seen
anything like it.

107
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:13,014
I dropped my phone. The
Superman dude was right there

108
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,842
and I dropped my phone,

109
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,453
- Annabelle!
- Naomi!

110
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,213
Can you believe it?
Did you know about this?

111
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:20,780
Because if you knew about this
and you didn't tell me,

112
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,719
- I'm going to be so mad.
- I missed it.

113
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:23,914
What do you mean, you missed it?

114
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,287
All I heard was the buzzing.

115
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,463
I didn't hear
anything like that.

116
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:30,684
Can you just tell me
what you saw?

117
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:33,295
Okay, so I was walking down the
street on my way home from school,

118
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:36,254
and all of a sudden, I look up
and there's this light in the sky.

119
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,866
So I run out of my store to see
where this light was coming from.

120
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,564
- I look up and I see...
- Superman.

121
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,741
This guy was legit.
He had a cape and everything.

122
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,545
He was fighting someone
from, like, the movies.

123
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,006
The bad guy? He was blue.
Like, literally, blue.

124
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,574
Blue guy throws Superman
onto a car, wham!

125
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:54,534
And then they just
keep fighting until, pow, pow.

126
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:55,970
Superman knocks him out cold.

127
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:58,538
So Superman grabs him
and then flies off.

128
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,191
And then it's over.

129
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:01,995
People are doing the most these
days for likes and clicks.

130
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,588
True, true. But best stunt ever.

131
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,329
Best stunt ever.

132
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,939
Best stunt ever.

133
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,596
Was it a projection?
Was it wires?

134
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,468
Lourdes, I have nothing to post
about what happened in my own town.

135
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,992
I'm sorry. I wish I could help,

136
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:19,950
but I have no idea who did this.

137
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:23,780
You're the only other person in town
who hardcore knows the comics world.

138
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:26,653
No way something like this happens
without you knowing about it.

139
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:30,657
I'm flattered, but I was going
to say the same thing to you.

140
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,658
What do you mean?

141
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:32,963
You always know what's going on,

142
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,009
especially if
it's about Superman.

143
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:37,751
I figured you had something
to do with it or knew who did.

144
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,623
Kind of a sore subject.

145
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,803
I got to go.

146
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,152
Text me if you hear anything?

147
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,197
Yeah.

148
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,200
Or even if you don't.

149
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:58,685
Oh.

150
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,558
You're sure
it wasn't the military?

151
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,214
Like an exercise or a flight
experiment or something?

152
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:07,432
No, I'm positive.

153
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,845
But with the dignitaries
arriving tomorrow,

154
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,653
and the presentation
the day after that,

155
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,350
it's all hands
on deck to prepare.

156
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,396
No one at the base planned this.

157
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,877
Temp's normal. No fever.

158
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,228
Sure you're okay, kid? You've
never been one to just faint.

159
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,403
I'm fine.

160
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:24,667
It was just... so weird.

161
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,930
Dinner is served, ladies.

162
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,892
Hey, you know the rules.

163
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:33,415
Time to put it away.

164
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,287
Lourdes keeps texting me
about the Superman thing.

165
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,506
Wait, Lourdes?

166
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,813
Wait. Which one is she again?

167
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,641
Purple hair.
She has a crush on Naomi.

168
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,338
Mom.

169
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,385
Does that mean no more Nathan?

170
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:48,691
They broke up last month.

171
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,171
I thought you were
dating Anthony.

172
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:53,783
Can we please
not talk about this?

173
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,785
You're dating
multiple people now.

174
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,570
They're all my friends. I like
them for different reasons.

175
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:02,139
You know, eventually,
you're gonna have to choose.

176
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,620
I'm 16. You really want me
to settle down?

177
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,926
I'm your father.

178
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,120
I want you to live
in that bedroom

179
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:08,784
with your stuffed animals
until you're 80.

180
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,715
It's not about
who you're dating.

181
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,195
It's about making a choice.

182
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:21,811
Is this turning into a talk? Feels
like this is turning into a talk.

183
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:25,597
No, no, we want you to be happy.

184
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,299
What the hell?

185
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,040
The camera's broken.

186
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:31,837
Hello?

187
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:54,208
They broke my camera,
right there.

188
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,514
What's up,
fellow Superman stans?

189
00:12:56,558 --> 00:13:00,388
Naomi McDuffie here
on the streets of Port Oswego.

190
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:03,478
Short post today because
I'm in deep investigation mode.

191
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,306
Getting answers
to your questions

192
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:08,788
about the Superman stunt
that went down yesterday.

193
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,921
I've read your comments,
I see all your questions,

194
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:15,316
and I've read what people
on other sites are saying.

195
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:18,754
Just know, those are
all assumptions. Guesses.

196
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,409
And I don't guess,
I deal with the facts.

197
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,325
I do the work, and you know me.

198
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,501
I always find the answers.

199
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:29,373
I've already uncovered some
information about the blatant tampering

200
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,201
and the cut wires
on Main Street.

201
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,290
I never thought
I'd be writing that.

202
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:35,423
I mean, this is
a Superman fan site.

203
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,686
We usually share
a love of comics.

204
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:40,645
But I'm on the case to find out
exactly who pulled this stunt,

205
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,647
why they did it,
and how they did it.

206
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,259
This is my town,

207
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:46,889
and I'm going to get
to the bottom of this,

208
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:49,829
and figure everything out.
I promise.

209
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,875
Babe, I say this with
all the love of my heart.

210
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,485
You gotta get a grip.

211
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:57,793
- I've never seen you like this.
- I need those videos, Anna.

212
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,404
This Superman thing
is getting weirder by the day.

213
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:03,712
The security cameras on Main
Street are all disabled.

214
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:06,671
Like cut wires,
blatant tampering.

215
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,588
There's something
bigger going on here.

216
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,895
Like what?

217
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,331
That's what I want to find out.

218
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,464
Babe, I know
you care about your site.

219
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,074
That's not what this is about.

220
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,423
What do you mean?

221
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:23,688
I remember when my dad
bought me my first comic.

222
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:28,171
We were living in Japan. I was
having trouble making friends.

223
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,653
Those comics have always
made me happy and free.

224
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,438
But ever since the stunt
in the Square, I feel off.

225
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,745
Off how?

226
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,966
This whole thing,
it has me feeling...

227
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,577
I don't know...

228
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,015
Strange. Not bad,
just different.

229
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,278
I don't even
recognize the feeling.

230
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,106
I have to figure out
what's happening.

231
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,851
It's almost ready.

232
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,114
Yeah, the sound just needs
a minute to sync.

233
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,030
Thanks for this.

234
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,312
I have all these
pieces of video,

235
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,904
but none of them
makes sense on their own.

236
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:07,732
Anything for you.

237
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:13,521
Even though you, uh, dumped me.

238
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:18,918
It doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

239
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,747
And how do you feel about me?

240
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,408
I feel a lot of things.
But mostly...

241
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,369
I feel like
you're a good person,

242
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,979
with a beautiful heart,

243
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,156
which makes the whole
thing with Anthony

244
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,680
and the party invite gone
wrong really weird to me.

245
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:45,596
I...

246
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,991
- It totally was an accident.
- He's a townie.

247
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,732
You don't like him.

248
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,690
No, I don't.

249
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,091
Maybe because you do.

250
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:17,498
- Is it ready?
- Ready.

251
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,657
Oh, my God!

252
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,103
Wow.

253
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,888
I knew it was cool,
but seeing it like that?

254
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:02,717
It looks so real.

255
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,154
How'd they do it?

256
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,678
Who's they and how
did they do what?

257
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,680
We don't even know
what we're looking at.

258
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,640
Well, let's look again.

259
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:13,684
Slower this time.

260
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Hang on. Pause it.

261
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,609
Is that Dee
from the tattoo shop?

262
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:33,574
What the hell?

263
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,929
It looks like
they know each other.

264
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:47,153
It feels weird that Dee
would be involved in this.

265
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,113
Sometimes people aren't
who you think they are.

266
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,033
Come on.

267
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,125
Not a Zumbado fan?

268
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,171
He's a bad person.

269
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:09,175
You've seen what happens when businesses
like that pop up around military bases.

270
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:12,308
They take advantage of folks who
are just trying to do their best.

271
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:16,138
You do have to be a special kind of
awful to rip off service members.

272
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,143
Don't know how
or what was happening.

273
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:38,029
- Naomi.
- Dee, uh, hi.

274
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,428
Hey, you wear glasses.

275
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:49,258
Um, yeah.

276
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,262
I like your designs.

277
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,264
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

278
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,397
Art has been a valuable tool

279
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,705
on my journey to live a more
centered and, uh, intentional life.

280
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:06,710
Right. So, um...

281
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:11,280
Dee, you and I haven't
talked much or ever,

282
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:13,369
and you're probably
wondering why I'm here.

283
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:16,503
Uh, I'm guessing
it's not for a tattoo.

284
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:19,332
Maybe when I turn 18.

285
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,204
Okay, deal.

286
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,859
March 14th, right?

287
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:29,603
That's the day I was adopted.

288
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:33,476
- How do you know that?
- Social media.

289
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,915
What can I do for you, Naomi?

290
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,049
We're trying to find out who's
behind the whole Superman thing.

291
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:43,791
In the video we saw,

292
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,185
it looked like you knew
the guy who was playing him.

293
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,100
I don't.

294
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:53,104
You didn't seem very surprised.

295
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,281
I was. I was very surprised.

296
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,244
No disrespect, but it feels like
you're leaving something out.

297
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,203
Oh, I'm... I'm not lying.

298
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:08,032
Naomi, I think
maybe we should go.

299
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,773
Yeah, I think you should.

300
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:12,602
I'm sorry.
This is just not good for my anxiety.

301
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,475
Please, can you
just give us some answers?

302
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:20,044
I can't give you answers when you're
not asking the right questions.

303
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,785
What does that mean?

304
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:32,100
Um... it was me, okay?

305
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:36,409
I did it. I planned
the fight on Main Street.

306
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:38,846
You planned it?

307
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:42,850
Why?

308
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,982
For publicity.

309
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:47,855
Business has been slow,
and I thought it would help.

310
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:51,032
So I hired an actor
with a jet pack.

311
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,991
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really
should be getting back to work.

312
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,129
What's up, guys?

313
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,436
I've been reading your
comments, and it's true.

314
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:06,308
Dee confessed to
the whole Superman stunt.

315
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:08,310
He said that
it was for publicity,

316
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,313
and that he hired
a guy with a jet pack.

317
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,707
I didn't see that coming.

318
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,839
I know it's not the answer
we were expecting.

319
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:20,627
No one had "guy from the tattoo
shop" on their list of suspects.

320
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,283
I guess, sometimes, people
aren't who you think they are.

321
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,937
Being chosen to debate

322
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,393
in front of the dignitaries
is a big deal.

323
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,767
So we got you
something to celebrate.

324
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,118
Surprise.

325
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,512
I don't get it.

326
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:39,863
- That's your set.
- You're letting me drive?

327
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:43,737
Naomi, you are a great student,
a great kid.

328
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,565
We're really proud of you.

329
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,137
I got to say,

330
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:55,183
we thought there'd be
a lot more screaming

331
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:57,620
and jumping
and general excitement.

332
00:21:57,664 --> 00:22:00,971
I am excited, really.
It's just...

333
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:07,804
Do you guys know Dee? The guy
who owns the tattoo parlor?

334
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,458
Are you guys friends with him?

335
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,504
'Cause he acted like he knew me.

336
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:14,202
He knew my adoption day.
No one knows that.

337
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,875
And he seemed surprised
that I wore glasses.

338
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,510
And why do I wear glasses?

339
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:19,860
Sometimes it seems like
they make my vision worse.

340
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,383
Honey, just take a deep breath.

341
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,603
You know why you wear glasses.

342
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:26,780
You have a condition called Leber
optic neuropathy. It's degenerative.

343
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:29,348
The glasses help slow
the damage to your eyes.

344
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:35,266
Okay, but what about Dee?

345
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,574
Do you guys think
he knew my birth parents,

346
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:43,057
and that's how he knows when
I was adopted or something?

347
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,669
Pumpkin, they died in that
crash far, far away from here.

348
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,584
You know that.

349
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:51,152
I don't see how Dee
could have known them.

350
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:54,068
This is a small town.
People talk.

351
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:01,684
Okay, yeah. Sorry.

352
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:05,035
Never be sorry for needing
to talk things through.

353
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,388
- Okay? We're here.
- Always.

354
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,608
Now, how would you like to have
your first practice session

355
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:15,132
and drive your folks
to the base?

356
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:18,309
- You ready?
- The question is, "Are youready?"

357
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,355
'Cause you've never seen
driving like this before.

358
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,226
How about just regular driving?

359
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,490
We should discuss my soundtrack.

360
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:37,546
"Is our behavior

361
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,941
controlled only by our genes?"

362
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,509
Miss Brooks, the floor is yours.

363
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:45,511
Thank you, Mr. Villarreal.

364
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,774
We all know that both
nature and nurture

365
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:49,950
play a factor
in our development,

366
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:52,039
but which matters more?

367
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,215
Many philosophers,
including Plato himself,

368
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:56,870
argued that genetics
play a much bigger role.

369
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,873
That is what I intend
to demonstrate today.

370
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:03,790
Miss McDuffie?

371
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,576
The floor is yours.

372
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:14,496
There's a reason why people have been
debating about this for such a long time.

373
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,716
It's because
there's no easy answer,

374
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,936
which is a hard thing to accept.

375
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:26,508
If genetics are everything, yes,

376
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:30,425
that does give us an answer.

377
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,254
But maybe it keeps us from having
to do the hardest thing of all...

378
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:38,215
decide who it is we want to be,

379
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:40,914
and understand...

380
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:44,526
that what made you feel happy

381
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,877
and free in one point
of your life may change,

382
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:51,272
and that's okay.

383
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:56,973
We have to be willing
to keep striving,

384
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:59,280
keep searching
and asking questions,

385
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:03,023
even when it's hard,

386
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,242
even when we're afraid
of the answers.

387
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,509
Even when the answers
don't make sense.

388
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:18,473
In the end, all we can
control is our choices,

389
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,521
and it's our choices
that determine our destiny.

390
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:36,665
Many argue that all of our
behaviors and characteristics

391
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,928
are a result of evolution.

392
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:43,803
What would you say
to those people?

393
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,678
First of all,
I would say that...

394
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,942
First of all, I would say
to those people...

395
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:01,951
Um, I would tell them that...

396
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:06,565
What I would tell them is...

397
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,827
Shall I repeat the question?

398
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,569
No, I... I heard you. I can't...

399
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,093
I need a moment, please.

400
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,190
Naomi!

401
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:28,848
Dr. Riley said he can't be
sure without running tests,

402
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,807
- but he thinks it was a panic attack.
- -Oh, okay.

403
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:33,896
That is way better
than what the Internet said.

404
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,464
By the way, very bad idea
to check symptoms online.

405
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,249
We have an appointment tomorrow.

406
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:43,689
But what if it's something else?

407
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,038
Like what?

408
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,910
I don't know.

409
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:51,218
This all started the day
of the Superman thing.

410
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:55,875
Maybe it's somehow connected,
like the same trick or device.

411
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:59,879
Yeah, but pumpkin, why would it
happen again here, on the base?

412
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,838
Greg, it's the doctor.

413
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,757
Good. They're gone.

414
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,933
Now we can talk about
what's really important.

415
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:13,849
You drive now?

416
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:15,808
Can you believe that?

417
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,134
I literally cannot. I thought
Jen and Greg would never cave.

418
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:20,421
- I know.
- -I mean, now we just have to get a car.

419
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:22,660
Obviously, you can't buy it
because you don't have a job,

420
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:26,514
and obviously, I can't buy it
because I also don't have a job.

421
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,603
But let's face it,
I don't want to drive.

422
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,822
I want to be driven.

423
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,737
I was thinking that...

424
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,144
I can see that.

425
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:53,106
"Superman landing,
Red River Forest."

426
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:44,113
What...

427
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,685
Okay, before you say anything,

428
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,142
I know I said I was coming to
your house, but I'm in the woods.

429
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,776
Naomi, what are you... Woods?

430
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,299
- Annabelle?
- Naomi...

431
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:58,301
Anna, I can't hear you.

432
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:00,564
- Anna, are you there?
- Naomi...

433
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:04,133
- Hello?
- -Not that much service out here, is there?

434
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,701
Zumbado.

435
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,051
What are you doing here?

436
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:12,489
It's a beautiful day.
I'm hiking.

437
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,362
What are you doing out here?

438
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:20,454
- I was, um...
- You were taking pictures.

439
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:23,196
I'm guessing for that
Superman website of yours?

440
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,719
How do you know about my site?

441
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,637
You know what
I find interesting, Naomi?

442
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,946
Out of all the comic book
characters in the world,

443
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,774
you chose Superman.

444
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:39,516
Why is that?

445
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,694
I mean, clearly you feel some type
of connection to that character.

446
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,696
We're both adopted.

447
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,440
You're either clueless,
full of yourself,

448
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:52,486
or you're just not ready
to face the truth.

449
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,968
Probably all three.

450
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,451
I'm gonna need that disk.

451
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:04,411
- What?
- Don't play dumb, Naomi.

452
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:06,021
I know you've been
looking for it.

453
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,849
First on Main Street,
and now here.

454
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,112
I don't even know what it is.

455
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:17,163
Wait. How did you know
that I was on Main Street?

456
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:24,300
You... You were following me.

457
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,347
Did you disable the cameras too?

458
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:30,654
The disk.

459
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,455
Stay back!

460
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:05,124
Can be hard once you realize
you're not like everyone else.

461
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:07,866
It was for me.

462
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,739
People start to look
at you differently.

463
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:20,879
But the trick is learning
to control your powers.

464
00:31:22,184 --> 00:31:24,186
I used to be ashamed
of who I was.

465
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,886
Thought something was wrong
with me, but there's not.

466
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:33,630
World's full of sheep.
I was meant for more.

467
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:38,766
I finally realized...

468
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:57,480
Why be a sheep
when you can be a wolf?

469
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:00,396
Stay back!

470
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:15,672
What was that? What did you do?

471
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:18,980
You think that I did that?

472
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:32,863
Don't believe everything
that you think, Naomi.

473
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,956
It's dangerous.

474
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,972
Okay, okay.

475
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:57,323
So instead of coming over to my
house, you went into the woods,

476
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:59,107
alone, by the way,

477
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,172
which we are definitely going
to be talking about later.

478
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:04,243
And then, in the woods,
you had what sounds like

479
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,114
a truly terrifying encounter,

480
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:08,963
which included the trees coming alive
in a real horror movie kind of way,

481
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,598
which makes you think that Zumbado
is the one behind the stunt

482
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:14,035
and all this weirdness
and not Dee,

483
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,776
even though Dee confessed.

484
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:16,820
Did I miss anything?

485
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:20,476
- No.
- Okay.

486
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,261
Okay?

487
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:24,263
- You believe me?
- Of course I believe you.

488
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,047
I know how crazy it all sounds.

489
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,309
You're not crazy, babe.

490
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:30,530
Look, when you've eliminated
the impossible,

491
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:33,968
whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.

492
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,102
I've been bingeing Sherlock.

493
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:39,254
Look, I don't understand how
Zumbado is involved in all this.

494
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,757
I mean, the guy
sells crappy cars.

495
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:44,065
I don't know, but he really
wanted that disk.

496
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:48,243
It must be valuable.

497
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,898
Okay, well,
what are we going to do?

498
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:53,857
It's not like we can walk into
Zumbado's shop and just look for it.

499
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,298
Oh, no. That's your
plan, isn't it?

500
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,691
We'll be in and out. He'll
never know that we were there.

501
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,303
Naomi, breaking and entering,
that's, like, serious stuff.

502
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:08,916
Not breaking and entering.
More like...

503
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,136
inviting-ourselves-
in-through-the-window-

504
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,313
while-Zumbado's-not-there
and entering.

505
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:16,358
We won't break anything.

506
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:19,057
Fine, but we're gonna need help.

507
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:26,629
I feel like we're in a movie.

508
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:30,242
Can we have code names?
I call Elrond.

509
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:31,286
From Lord of the Rings.

510
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,331
Sorry I'm late.

511
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,335
What's he doing here?

512
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:39,033
- Awkward.
- Did you bring them?

513
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:44,560
Ponies.

514
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:45,953
- Cute.
- Ha-ha.

515
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,955
It's my sister's.
It's all I could find.

516
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:50,392
Okay, here's the plan.

517
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:53,003
Two people will stay outside
and be lookouts.

518
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:55,310
Elrond to Aragorn,

519
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:57,225
we're good to go
for the Precious.

520
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,401
Dude, no one knows that means.

521
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:01,838
Philistines.

522
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:03,710
The rest of us
will jump the fence...

523
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:12,197
then sneak inside.

524
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:17,724
Annabelle?

525
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,030
- How does it look?
- All clear.

526
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,990
I think. I've never
actually done this before.

527
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,423
What the hell?

528
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:58,520
March 14th, 2004.

529
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:06,354
Is that Dee?
He looks exactly the same.

530
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:10,445
- The mysterious...
- Naomi, I think we found something.

531
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,412
Maybe he keeps cash in there?

532
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:22,370
What I need is in that safe.

533
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:24,894
We have to open it.

534
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:30,987
Zumbado's coming.

535
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,076
You need to get out
of there now.

536
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:54,402
Let's go, come on.

537
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,412
- Come on.
- Let's split up.

538
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:06,022
Yeah.

539
00:38:19,775 --> 00:38:22,169
You told me I wasn't asking
the right questions.

540
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,652
What did you mean by that?

541
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,698
I shouldn't have said that.

542
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:40,143
The Superman thing
wasn't you, was it?

543
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:42,885
No.

544
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,373
Why did you lie?

545
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,766
You were upset.

546
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:57,639
I'm... I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

547
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,949
Then how about a conversation?

548
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,214
Please talk to me.

549
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,607
I need answers.

550
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,047
I'm not the guy who's got them.

551
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:16,484
I'm nobody.

552
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:28,888
But I'll try.

553
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,677
This happened here before,

554
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:38,419
on the day I was adopted.

555
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:41,074
You were there.

556
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:45,252
Yes, I was there.

557
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:51,214
Something happened to me
during the Superman thing,

558
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:55,175
and then again
at the military base.

559
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,960
I heard all this buzzing.

560
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,701
And then I went to the woods

561
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:01,442
and found some kind of disk,

562
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:04,402
-with all this weird writing on it...
- Wait.

563
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,840
Go back to the buzzing.

564
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:10,625
I've never heard
or felt anything like it.

565
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:13,628
It made me dizzy and weak.

566
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,674
No one else
seemed to be affected.

567
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,328
Do you know what it was?

568
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:21,896
No.

569
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:26,424
But it may have something to do

570
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:29,383
with people like us.

571
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:35,171
People like us.
What are you talking about?

572
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:40,220
You know, it wasn't
supposed to happen like this.

573
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,876
It wasn't time yet.

574
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,580
But I guess things have changed.

575
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,105
Time for what?

576
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:00,196
The truth.

577
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,469
Who are you?

578
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:13,471
Still the wrong question.

579
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,217
Dee, what's hap`${counter}` == subsLinesArr[lineIndex]pening?

580
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:34,709
What is the question?

581
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:44,545
What is the question, Naomi?

582
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,810
The question is...

583
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,772
Who am I?
